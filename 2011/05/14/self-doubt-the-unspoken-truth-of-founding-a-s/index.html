	<div class="entry-content"><div>Founding a startup has been a dream of mine, for as long as I can remember. I methodically went about learning as much as I could about what it took to build a company from nothing to a going concern.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I don&#8217;t remember the exact moment (I was between 8 - 10 years old though) when I realized that in order to build a business, I had to come up with an idea first. Ever since then I conditioned myself (almost literally) to constantly come up with ideas. So much so that I became the annoying sibling/son/friend that always had a new idea. Luckily for me, I have another friend that was just as prolific, probably even more prolific, at coming up with ideas as I did [wassup Simms :)]. When I was ridiculed, I wasn&#8217;t the only one receiving it. As a result of that, I have learned to speak less, and do more. I only share with a select few (my poor wife has to bear it all the time - for better or worse, right ?).</div>
<p> </p>
<div>But somewhere along the way, I realized that there is more to building a successful business than coming up with an idea. So I set out to do everything I could to learn about business and startups before jumping into mine. For instance:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I have read every single <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham essay</a>
</li>
<li>Subscribed to <a href="http://www.inc.com/">Inc. magazine</a> for three to four years while I lived in the US - read each issue cover to cover for my entire subscription.</li>
<li>Subscribed to <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com">Entrepreneur magazine</a> and did the same.</li>
<li>Read most of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Problem-Solution/dp/1430210788/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305354762&amp;sr=8-1">Founders at Work</a> by Jessica Livingston (Paul Graham&#8217;s wife)</li>
<li>Read books/articles/stories about many tech founders from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Semiconductor">Fairchild Semiconductor</a> to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/">Facebook</a>. I know many of them by name and obscure facts about many of them, e.g. Apple had <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-06-07/business/ct-biz-0607-wayne--20100607_1_iphone-steve-wozniak-apple-i-computer">three co-founders</a> (not just two), etc.</li>
<li>Convinced I was going to do a tech startup, I did my undergrad degree in Computer Science and did my MBA with a concentration in Finance (finance is the life blood of every company, right?) after.</li>
<li>I love economics, finance, and all that good stuff. I day traded currencies for a while. I understand markets - supply &amp; demand and the battle between Capital &amp; Labor.</li>
<li>I know all the startup theory - <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startups</a>, <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/what-is-customer-development.html">Customer Development</a>, etc.</li>
<li> I have decent-ish karma on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>.</li>
<li>I worked with a startup company for a while, and understand the internal struggles of having to produce a lot with very minimal resources.</li>
<li>Once I finally decided to take the plunge and do my startup I <a href="http://blog.compversions.com/learning-ruby-on-rails-css-jquery-building-a">taught myself all the programming</a> I need to know to build the product I wanted to build.</li>
<li>I finally launched and got a good reception from <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2460406">many</a> <a href="http://forrst.com/posts/Bootstrapped_10_months_Learned_Rails_Finally-LHf#comment-land">quarters</a>. People like what they see. Had a few bugs, but have squashed most of the ones brought to my attention so far, and making good progress on the rest.</li>
</ul>
<div>Now what? Now I have to go and sell it. Oh Crap! </div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>This is where the self-doubt kicks in.</strong></div>
<p></p>
<div>Sure, I spoke to a bunch of people before building it. I validated the idea and I knew that this was a particular problem, because I experienced the pain and I know others that had this problem too. But now&#8230;..now I have to collect money from people. People I don&#8217;t know, and who don&#8217;t know me.</div>
<p></p>
<div>The transition from hardcore development to sales/marketing has been a tough one for me. I think I underestimated the mental switch needed to jump from one to the other. Especially since I don&#8217;t have the luxury of having someone else carry on with the development while I do the sales. If I do nothing, nothing happens. Knowing that, makes the self-doubt worse. But, it also makes it better. Because I know that if I do nothing, nothing happens. So I have to do something, so I end up doing something.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Self-doubt, when you are doing this for the first time (or second, third or fourth time) is perfectly normal. That&#8217;s how it is when you are just learning to ride, drive, fly or anything else new.</div>
<p></p>
<div>The trick is to persevere, because the only way to become confident in your abilities and be successful is to push through the doubt and get better little by little.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So stop distracting yourself with Hacker News, TechMeme, TechCrunch or any other activity/site you use as an excuse to escape the doubt you feel when you think about what you have to do.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Take a deep breath, and push through.</div>
<p></p>
<div>As the saying goes&#8230;Keep Calm, Carry On.</div>
<p></p>
