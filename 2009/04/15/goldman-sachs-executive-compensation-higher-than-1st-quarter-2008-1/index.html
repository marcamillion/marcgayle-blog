	<h2 class="title">Goldman Sachs Executive Compensation 18% Higher Than Q1 2008</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">So Goldman Sachs has officially released results for Q1 - 2009.  They were significantly better than analysts&#8217; estimates. Surprise, surprise. Most intriguing though, are the details of their earnings. When they just announced the results they caught <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chdet=1239757314570&amp;chddm=8211&amp;q=NYSE:GS&amp;ntsp=0" title="Goldman Sachs stock price movement" target="_blank">Wall Street by surprise and there was a rally</a>, but it seems that something changed investors&#8217; minds. Either the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=adCZ1eS0OeFM" title="Goldman announces $5B equity dilution to pay back TARP" target="_blank">$5B equity dilution they announced</a>, or there is something else in their earnings report that investors are acting on. Let&#8217;s look more closely at their numbers.

The breakdown is as follows:

<strong>Revenues</strong>
<ul>
<li>Net Revenues of $9.43B, Net Earnings of $1.81B</li>
	<li>Diluted EPS of $3.39 vs $3.23 for Q1 - 2008 vs -$4.97 for Q4 - 2008. </li>
	<li>Diluted EPS of $3.39 beating the average analyst estimate by $1.64.</li>
	<li>Net Revenues in Investment Banking were $823M, 30% lower than Q1 - 2008 </li>
	<li>Net Revenues in Financial Advisory were $527M, 21% lower than Q1 - 2008</li>
	<li>Net Revenus in Underwriting Business were $296M, 42% lower than Q1 - 2008</li>
	<li>Net Revenues in Trading &amp; Principal Investments were $7.15B vs $5.12B for Q1 - 2008 &amp; -$4.36B for Q4 - 2008</li>
	<li>Net Revenues in Fixed Income, Currency &amp; Commodities (FICC) were $6.56B, more than double Q1 - 2008 (no figure given)</li>
	<li>Net Revenues in Equities were $2B, 20% lower than Q1 - 2008</li>
	<li>Net Revenues in Asset Management &amp; Securities Services were $1.45B, 29% lower than Q1 - 2008 vs 17% lower than Q4 - 2008.
<ul>
<li>Assets Under Management (AUM) decreased $27B to $771B, due to $16B market depreciation and $11B in net outflows.</li>
	<li>Net Revenues for Securities Services were $503M, 30% lower than Q1 - 2008.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Expenses</strong>
<ul>
<li>Operating Expenses were $6.8B, 10% higher than Q1 - 2008.</li>
	<li>
<strong>Compensation &amp; Benefits Expenses were $4.71B, 18% higher than Q1 - 2008</strong><em><strong>. </strong></em>
</li>
	<li>Ratio of Compensation &amp; Benefits to Net Revenues increased to 50%, vs. 48% for Q1 - 2008.</li>
	<li>Employment levels decreased 7% compared with Q4 - 2008.</li>
	<li>Non-compensation expenses were $1.62B, 21% lower than Q1 - 2008 vs. 25% lower than Q4 - 2008.</li>
	<li>Effective Income Tax Rate was 31%, up from 1% for 2008 &amp; 29.5% for Q1 - 2008  (this 1% figure makes sense due to all the write-offs and losses they took in 2008)</li>
</ul>
This is why accounting is so tricky. I am a bit confused. Their Fixed Income Assets actually decreased from $259B Q1 - 2008 to $248B Q1 - 2009, actually their total AUM decreased to $771B from $873B in Q1 2008. They had net (outflows) of $3B in Fixed Income as opposed to a Net Inflow of $2B in Q1 - 2008. 

So the big question is, how on earth (in a quarter when the majority of all their streams of revenue declined) did they pull off revenues in Fixed Income Commodities &amp; Currency doubling. FICC Revenues jumped from $3.14B in Q1 - 2008 to $6.557B in Q1 - 2009.

How is that possible, when their AUM across the board declined, and revenues across the board declined?

So their &#8220;revenues&#8221; increased, in a year when <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/creditcrisis/recipients/table" title="Goldman Receives TARP money" target="_blank">they took TARP money</a>, raised <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/10485200/1/buffetts-goldman-investment-is-locked-in.html" title="Warren Buffet buys $5B worth of GS preferred shares" target="_blank">private equity from the likes of Warren Buffet</a>, and received a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSTRE5260AY20090307?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews" title="Goldman and others get payout from AIG" target="_blank">payout from AIG</a> and they decided to <strong>increase </strong>executive compensation? 

I am not saying that Goldman is doing fraudulent activity, but these results do raise some flags. It could be that I have misread something, or glanced over something glaringly obvious to the &#8216;trained eye&#8217;, and if that&#8217;s the case please point out my error in the comments.

What would be interesting to look into is if Paulson currently owns (or owns an interest in any fund/company) that owns Goldman stock. I am not really one to rally the troops and bring out the pitch forks, but sometimes I am most definitely tempted!
