  <div class="entry-content"><div>I have been meaning to write this post for a while, but it kept getting delayed. Then Mashable published <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/11/11/google-promoted-account/">this article</a> about Google Advertising on Twitter.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So I figured now is as good a time as any.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I am no ad buying expert, but if Microsoft can bid on very cheap/obscure keywords (i.e. the extreme longtail) - e.g. every single keyword that costs $0.01 or less (if that even exists), assuming that the revenue they can generate per lead is greater than $0.01, then why not do it? Then from there, experiment with $0.02 keywords, and progress accordingly.</div>
<p></p>
<div>It is possible (I would think), by doing that - rather than an <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10255678-56.html">aggressive mainstream media advertising blitz</a> - that their conversion rates would be much better and they could steal a good chunk of Google&#8217;s traffic.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Naturally, it has to make economic sense. I imagine they must measure the cost of every lead and with the waste that is generated with large TV campaigns, it&#8217;s not hard to conceive that a strict online ad inventory buying campaign would generate warmer leads than an offline TV campaign.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Am I wrong? Would love to hear some thoughts on that.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Edit: Some interesting links provided to me by the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1895324" target="_blank">thread on Hacker News</a>, although they don&#8217;t specifically point out data from Bing, it is interesting nonetheless: </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a general entity – i.e. a person, for-profit &amp; non-profit organization – credibility comes down to simply doing what you say you are going to do, and the converse – not doing what you say you wouldn’t. Politicians tend to face this crisis all too often. But so do companies. The following example is one such case.</p>
<p>I have been a long time subscriber to <a href="http://www.mint.com/" style="color: #5f5f5f;">mint.com</a>. But, for some reason, I just stopped using it some time ago. Six months after not logging in, in a while, I got this message:</p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<img alt="Mint-urgent-message-in-may-20101" height="538" src="/marcgayle-blog/images/2010/10/02/when-do-you-lose-credibility-message-to-indin/16959841-mint-urgent-message-in-may-20101.png" width="500">
</div>

<p> </p>
<p>At first, I was a bit shocked – because the subject of this email was “ACTION REQUIRED – Your Weekly Financial Summary from Mint.com”. This was the second time I was getting this email. The first time I got it, six months prior, I quickly logged in. This time, even though I was shocked, I realized that my mint.com account was not worth it enough to cause me to stop doing what I am doing right now to log in. I said I would do it later, and I never got around to it. So I got another one of these messages the following week.</p>
<p>After the 6th week, I started to question the credibility of the threat. Funnily enough, by threatening to cancel my account 6 weeks in, and not canceling it makes me want to cancel it – because it erodes the value proposition. Five months later, and I am still receiving these email threats on a weekly basis. Here is the latest:</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<img alt="Mint-urgent-message-in-october-2010" height="285" src="/marcgayle-blog/images/2010/10/02/when-do-you-lose-credibility-message-to-indin/16959842-mint-urgent-message-in-october-2010.png" width="500">
</div>

<p>Needless to say, I will likely send them a message requesting them to delete my account and take me off of their mailing list.</p>
<p>Word to the wise: <a href="http://www.indinero.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">InDinero</a>, you say you are the Mint.com for businesses. There are many things Mint has done right. This is not one of them. Please learn from their mistakes. You show much promise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever wanted to have a nice, clean looking notepad – that scales with the amount of elements you need to write on it – in HTML &amp; CSS? So did I for the <a href="http://compversions.com/" title="CompVersions - Compare multiple=" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">startup</a> I am working on. Could I find anything? Nope. So, I made one. It’s nothing fancy, and should look pretty close to this:</p>
<p></p>

<p>The notepad was designed by the wonderful <a href="http://www.andreeblixt.com/" title="Andree Blixt" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">Andree Blixt</a>.</p>
<p>To see an online demo, check it out <a href="http://compversions.com/notepad/" title="Notepad in HTML &amp; CSS" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">here</a>. It is released under the MIT license, so do what you want with it. The only thing I ask is for attribution. Also, please feel free to suggest updates/tweaks/enhancements especially to show multiple pages and adding jQuery animation if you would like (either in the comments or <a href="mailto:%20marc@compversions.com" style="color: #5f5f5f;">emailing me</a> directly).</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://marcgayle.com/2010/05/28/an-open-letter-to-alexis-ohanian-reddit-cofounder/" title="An open letter to Alexis Ohanian" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">prior post</a> I came out in swinging defense of what I thought was Kevin’s courageous attempt to save Digg and Alexis’s misguided criticisms.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Digg V4 has decided to focus on ‘large publishers’ (like Alexis had thought they would) rather than ‘small publishers’ (whichh I thought they were).</p>
<p>So, given that I quickly (and loudly) appealed to Alexis to be cautious with his critique, I feel it is appropriate to (just as loudly) apologize and admit that I was wrong, and am now disappointed in Digg and Kevin.</p>
<p>I stand corrected Alexis, you were right.</p>
<p>Please note that I am not apologizing just because the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/pda/2010/aug/31/digg-redesign-revolt" title="Digg Users Revolt over v4" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">community revolted</a> – communities always revolt when change happens, but they often get used to it – but I am acknowledging that Alexis correctly saw what the true changes at Digg were, as I did not.</p>

</div>

<p>A typical shopping mall parking lot starts off empty, and drivers navigate to the best parking spot of their choosing. If they get there early, they get the spot right in front of the door.</p>
<p>If they don’t, they get the spot all the way at the back and have to walk for miles.</p>
<p>If they are lucky enough to be driving past a sweet spot that someone is coming out of, they got lucky – and can seize it.</p>
<p>Left uninhibited, most parking lots will function fine. The average driver is capable enough to navigate through the parking lot and use it efficiently without any external guidance.</p>
<p>However, every now and then there is that douchebag that parks in two spaces in a completely jammed parking lot.</p>
<p>There is that annoying driver that decided to mess around and ends up bumping someone else, and causes a traffic jam.</p>
<p>There is that very heavy traffic day, where many drivers are agitated and need to get somewhere quickly – which causes everybody to get where they are going slowly.</p>
<p>In those situations, you need a traffic cop (i.e. regulator).</p>
<p>However, if you had many traffic cops directing traffic into and out of every parking space, traffic would slow to a crawl most of the time – because you know those moments when he tells you to go right, but you thought he said left and you have to now reverse and go back right, but then he had told you to just continue going left and there is that few seconds of uncertainty on both parts about what to do…those moments would be multiplied many times by the number of drivers and traffic cops.</p>
<p>So while free market capitalism has ushered in significant advancements in medicine, technology, standard of living, etc., every now and then it needs a traffic cop.</p>
<p>For those douchebag drivers…not you, of course.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Palatino, Georgia, Baskerville, serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666; line-height: 18px;"> </span></p>
<p>I recently had a need for video compression software. I was working on a <a href="http://www.ideatin.com/" title="IdeaTin" style="color: #5f5f5f;">side project</a>, that involved compressing video and releasing it online.</p>
<p>I tried many different pieces of freeware and they all came up short. They were either too complicated, or didn’t quite do a good job. I settled on <a href="http://www.sorensonmedia.com/video-encoding/" title="Sorenson Squeeze 6" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">Sorenson Squeeze 6</a>. I have had experience with one of the earlier versions and remember it being pretty nice to use and the results were pretty good (i.e. relatively small size for high quality video).<span> </span></p>
<p>So I checked them out, being that it is a small project I was not on the market for anything TOO expensive. $800? No way. I continued searching for a free/cheaper alternative but with all the demos I downloaded, they always came up short. I decided to bite the bullet and get it.</p>
<p>Got it, worked beautifully. It’s an awesome product…really. It’s very intuitive, very powerful and has MANY settings. I used it for <a href="http://www.ideatin.com/" style="color: #5f5f5f;">IdeaTin</a> and decided that I should really get around to resizing all my home videos. Yes, all 700GB of them. Every single HD tape that I rip is about 30GB. I definitely don’t need ‘HD’ quality, but I never got around to figuring out how to reduce the size of my library. Now that I have Squeeze 6, I can finally tackle it in a sane way. To Sorenson’s credit, I emailed them telling them about my project and that the $800 price is too steep (also that I found Squeeze 6 at another online store for $200 cheaper). They refunded me $200 off the purchase price, no questions asked. I was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>I have a Windows 7 machine, 1 iMac + 1 Macbook Pro. The idea was that given the size of the library, I would have it running on all three machines at the same time to reduce the total amount of time spent re-encoding the library. Got it installed on the MBP and Windows 7 machine fine, no problems.</p>
<p>Tried to install on the iMac, no can do. Contact customer support, they say 1 Serial Number, 1 machine. Ok, I get such a policy in business environments (mid-size to large companies anyway).  I get it for Operating Systems, where it is the core of the system. The very foundation of the computer.</p>
<p>But for a home/small business, where people realistically own multiple machines, and for an application designed to do ‘heavy-lifting’ (where having multiple machines running at the same time will reduce the load) this policy should be re-evaluated. I get that there might be technical challenges with detecting who is telling the truth and who is trying to scam you, but I would be willing to bet that these types of policies turn off more legitimate users than deter pirates. If I were to pirate any software, I can install it on as many machines as I like. If it doesn’t work, I don’t have to use it and have no buyer’s remorse. If I buy software and it doesn’t do what I want, or there are restrictions (especially for the more expensive variety), having buyer’s remorse is the software company’s worst enemy.</p>
<p>In this case, Sorenson might be better served at least waving it for those that have a legitimate reason – what is the marginal cost of issuing one more serial number to someone that owns a small business or is using your software at home and has bought your software? Nothing. You don’t have to contact the customer, they will contact you. You don’t have to ship any new CDs or any new documentation. A simple email would suffice.</p>
<p>An alternative route that Sorenson could take is, build an ‘add-on’ application that comes with the software (free) for this particular use case. If you want to restrict me to just using it one or two machines, fine. But have an ‘applet’ that allows me to install a small app on additional computers that allow me to just do a single function (run batch encoding while the main machines are also running – or some variation thereof).</p>
<p>For all software makers out there, it might be beneficial in the short-term interest of the company to restrict the use of your software in ways YOU deem it appropriate to be used, but you simply risk diluting your brand equity in the long term. Imagine you buy a BMW and they tell you where you can drive it or who you can lend your car to.</p>
<p>Oh, and Sorenson, I know that when I bought your software I ‘agreed’ to these terms in the EULA. No need to throw it in my face when I am inquiring about them with your customer support. Your EULA should be protection against fringe cases, an escape of last resort. Not the first line of defense.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Marc,</p>
<p>Per your user agreement, you are only allowed one activation per license. If you would like more information on purchasing a license for multiple users, contact <a href="mailto:sales@sorensonmedia.com" style="color: #5f5f5f;">sales@sorensonmedia.com</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is to wishing that software companies will wise up and start allowing customers to do what they want with their software, once they take your money.</p>

<p>Say it ain&#8217;t so? As far as I know, I was never told that Blizzard would be using my bandwidth to serve other clients. I hope I didn&#8217;t miss it in the long EULA I skimmed over and agreed to.</p>
<p>As you can see in the image above, I am downloading Starcraft 2 Beta from a number of &#8216;peers&#8217;. I have a unique Peer ID (blacked out for privacy purposes), and each of my peers have the same. The leftmost column is the IP address for all the clients I am connected to, and the rightmost column is their Peer ID.</p>
<p>What is also curious is my download speed is only twice my upload speed. Sometimes it is even equal. It seems to me that Blizzard does this to keep as many peers as active as possible. There is no option to throttle my upspeed, or downspeed for that matter.</p>
<p>I love Blizzard and all, but these &#8216;sneaky&#8217;, old media, tactics are not befitting such a forward thinking company as Blizzard.</p>
<p>Perhaps this could have been buried in the EULA, and if that is the case, without any other notification, I feel&#8230;.kind of&#8230;taken advantage of.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Edit: Just re-read the EULA and saw point #3 which discusses this issue:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">3. Distribution of the Game. </span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Blizzard may choose to distribute the Game through the use of the &#8220;Blizzard Downloader&#8221; utility which utilizes the &#8216;upload&#8217; capability of your computer to distribute the Game to other participants of the Beta Test. In such an event, you agree that Blizzard may distribute the Game by using your home computer to &#8216;upload&#8217; all or part of the Game to other participants of the Beta Test.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Another particularly heinous section of their EULA is Ominously titled &#8216;Consent to Monitor&#8217;.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">8. Consent to Moniter.</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> WHEN RUNNING, THE GAME MAY MONITOR YOUR COMPUTER&#8217;S RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (RAM) FOR UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAMS RUNNING CONCURRENTLY WITH THE GAME.

IN THE EVENT THAT THE GAME DETECTS AN UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAM, THE GAME MAY (a) COMMUNICATE INFORMATION BACK TO BLIZZARD, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION YOUR ACCOUNT NAME, DETAILS ABOUT THE UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAM DETECTED, AND THE TIME AND DATE THE UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAM WAS DETECTED; AND/OR (b)  EXERCISE ANY OR ALL OF ITS RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WITH OR WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE TO THE USER.</span></p>
