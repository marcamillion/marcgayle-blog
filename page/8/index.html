  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok…hate is such a strong word. I don’t exactly hate them…I don’t hate anyone actually (not that I can think of ). However, the image below illustrates why they have fallen from grace, and shows what is fundamental wrong with them.</p>
<p>To explain, I just finished doing a fresh install of XP for a friend and am installing the pre-requisite stuff. Acrobat (PDF reader) was one of them, just because I needed something to read PDFs and that’s the first thing that comes to mind. So I google ‘Acrobat Download’ and am given a link that takes me to their download page. I click download and the screenshot captures what happens next (click to view fullscreen):</p>

<img alt="Adobe_sucks" height="375" src="/marcgayle-blog/images/2010/04/21/why-i-hate-adobe/16963761-adobe_sucks.jpg" width="500">
</div>

<p>As you can see….they force me to download ‘Adobe Download Manager’ plug-in by ‘getPlus’ (who the hell is getPlus? – That’s rhetorical, I don’t know and don’t care they are also in my bad books) for Firefox. Then, I have to restart Firefox, which then loads Adobe Download Manager, which then hits me with a ton of banner ads that slide from side to side (that I can’t close or block) and, while downloading Acrobat – which I then have to install. On top of that, once acrobat is installed, they also installed ‘Adobe Air’. It could have been that they gave me the option to opt-out, but I was so pissed by this install process that I glossed over it, but it just made the entire process even worse.</p>
<p>Is Adobe joking? This reminds me of some shady ‘third-party’ app site. I will not be going through that process again, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>The worst part is, Acrobat isn’t even the best free PDF reader. Next time I will go with my <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/reader/" title="Free PDF Reader for Windows" target="_blank">usual default</a>.</p>
<p>Adobe…stop worrying about <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/iphone_agreement_bans_flash_compiler" title="Apple changes iPhone Developers' Terms of Service" target="_blank">Apple’s 3.3.1 change in their iPhone TOS</a> and start focusing on your own customers and improving their experiences and lives. Maybe if you did that, and made Flash better people wouldn’t allow Apple to get away with the shafting they are now giving you and many other developers.</p>

As a follow-up to my last piece about <a href="http://marcgayle.com/2010/04/08/why-jason-fried-david-heinemeir-hanson-are-wrong/" title="Why Jason Fried and DHH are wrong about one thing" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">Jason F. &amp; DHH being wrong about one thing</a>, which generated a bunch of chatter (surprisingly more on twitter than on HN) and commentary, I have confirmed that they are indeed right about at least one other thing (I am sure they are right about many things, but I have solid proof for this one).
<p>In their latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1271541853&amp;sr=8-1" title="Rework - by Jason Fried &amp; DHH [Amazon]" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">Rework</a> [Amazon], one of their many principles are ‘pick a fight’. They also talk about having a point of view. So that’s exactly what I did. I read their book, was impressed by how they <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2209-karl-roves-book-vs-rework-what-the-american-people-need-to-know" title="Rework: Karl Rove Attack Ad" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">followed their own advice</a>, and while I agreed with most of their points there was one that I strongly disagreed with. That is their notion that companies should stay small and not aim to grow. I believe <a href="http://marcgayle.com/2010/04/08/why-jason-fried-david-heinemeir-hanson-are-wrong/" title="Why Jason Fried and DHH are wrong" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">we have a moral obligation to grow the companies/ideas that have the ability</a> to do so. Be sure to check out the <a href="http://marcgayle.com/2010/04/08/why-jason-fried-david-heinemeir-hanson-are-wrong/#comment-93" title="DHH replies to why I think he is wrong" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">comments</a>, as the discussion continued.</p>
<p>I can only assume that the reason they say you should pick a fight or have a point of view is that you stand out and get attention (because many companies don’t take sides/positions). If I am wrong, DHH or Jason, please feel free to correct me.</p>
<p>As a result of my fight picking, I saw a huge bump in traffic. I submitted the article to HN and nothing much happened – I had expected a bigger bang, but it puttered out the gate and fizzled in the HN-upcoming story graveyard. Then as a last ditch effort to generate some traffic I simply <a href="http://twitter.com/marcgayle/status/11840978453" title="Tweet about why JF &amp; DHH are wrong" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">sent out a tweet</a>, and both DHH &amp; Jason Fried responded. <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/11842240519" title="Jason Fried's tweet" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">JF retweeted it</a>, and DHH responded on the actual article.</p>
<p>Here are my traffic graphs:</p>

<p>I don’t understand why the bulk of the traffic referrals come up as ‘direct’ when I know that many of them came from either twitter or the bit.ly URL created by Jason Fried and tweeted out.</p>
<p>So, once you have a point of view, and someone else to pick a fight with…doing so can get you some amount of attention.</p>

<p>I have been stumbling across many of these infographics lately, and I couldn’t not share them here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.intac.net/" target="_blank">Intac.net</a> recently put out an awesome infographic that illustrates the companies that dominate the internet (in terms of number of servers). Guess who is the leader, by a long shot. It’s quite staggering actually.Make sure to read the disclaimer at the bottom though….there’s always a disclaimer. Still informative and quite telling.</p>

Sometimes it is easy for us to get sidetracked by the ‘larger’ challenges that Obama is tackling, that we miss the little things before our very eyes. Americans won’t see the effects of health care reform for another few years, easily. The same would apply to financial reform and a carbon cap/trade/credit law.
<p>However, there is a <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/05/credit_card_legislation_become.html" title="Credit Card Legislation" target="_blank">little bill that was passed in May 2009</a> that I, personally, have directly seen the effects of. </p>
<p>Below is one of my credit card statements as of February 2010:</p>
<p></p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<img alt="Credit-card-feb-2010" height="165" src="/marcgayle-blog/images/2010/04/15/change-my-credit-card-can-believe-in/16966791-Credit-Card-Feb-2010.png" width="500">

Nothing majorly significant. All it shows is previous balance, summary of payments or purchases, finance charges minimum payment, etc. I grayed out information that could possibly be used for nefarious purposes (not you wonderful people reading my blog…the other dishonest people on the interwebs).
<p>Contrast that with my statement from March 2010:</p>
<p></p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<img alt="Credit-card-march-2010" height="309" src="/marcgayle-blog/images/2010/04/15/change-my-credit-card-can-believe-in/16966790-Credit-Card-March-2010.png" width="500">
</div>

<p>March is COMPLETELY different. Breaking down how much I will pay total if I stick with the minimum payment or if I paid a higher amount. It doesn’t matter much to me, because I always pay more than my minimum, but it just jumps out at you how much you are paying in interest.</p>
<p>That, is change I can believe in!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished reading <a href="http://37signals.com/rework/" title="Rework from 37Signals" target="_blank">Rework</a> and am pumped to continue working on my side projects. I also just read an interesting post titled <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2010/04/i_am_a_racist.php" title="I am a racist" target="_blank">‘I am a racist’ by Mark C. Chu-Carroll</a> and they both really got me thinking.</p>
<p>I am a huge fan of <a href="http://www.37signals.com/" title="37 Signals" target="_blank">37signals</a> (who isn’t these days?), and typically agree with their <a href="http://www.37signals.com/rework" title="Rework" target="_blank">business philosophies</a> and <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/" title="Getting Real: 37 Signals" target="_blank">software development approach</a>.</p>
<p>DHH recently had an <a href="http://thisweekinstartups.com/2010/03/twist-46-with-david-heinemeier-hansson/" title="This Week in Startups - David Heinemeir Hanson" target="_blank">interview with Jason Calacanis</a>, where there was an interesting face-off between the two schools of thought. DHH is a major proponent of building your company from internal cash-flows and eventual profits, while Jason C. believes you should take outside funding when you can (I am simplifying here, so please don’t send hate mail if this doesn’t spell out their philosophies exactly).</p>
<p>During this interview, DHH mentioned that you should always be working on your best idea – i.e. there is no reason for you to want to sell your company because there is no guarantee that you will come up with as good an idea, or even a better idea, the next time around. In his case, he can see himself still with 37signals in 20 years, because he is confident that he is working on his best idea now. He has no plans to exit. Jason Fried even went so far as to write a <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1927-the-next-generation-bends-over" title="The next-generation bends over" target="_blank">blog post blasting the sale of Mint.com</a> to Intuit because Aaron Patzer (Mint’s founder) ‘sold out’.</p>
<p>During another interview with<a href="http://mixergy.com/bootstrapping-37signals/" title="Mixergy - 37Signals" target="_blank"> Jason Fried on Mixergy</a>, Andrew Warner (the interviewer) challenged him about wanting to build a large business and Jason pushed back defending his stance about staying small.</p>
<p>There is a certain zen-like quality to these notions that Jason &amp; DHH espouse, and I whole-heartedly adopt many of them. I understand, and agree with, Jason &amp; DHH’s point about focussing on building a solid company based on profits and real customers rather than VCs and eyeballs. I also agree that large companies tend to be inefficient, cumbersome and slow-to-respond. I do acknowledge that there are inherent risks with leaving one successful venture behind. In that, it is possible that you will never be able to ‘strike gold’ twice and come up with more than one businesses that are as successful as the first.</p>
<p>However, where I fundamentally disagree with them on is the notion that we should never sell and stick to one company for many, many years (if not our entire entrepreneurial lives).</p>
<p>The reason I disagree is because by the very nature that I have the ability and wherewithal to build a large successful company and sell, there is a high probability that I can do it again (when I say I, I mean anyone – not me specifically, but hopefully me in the future:) ). This ability is so rare, that those that have it, should not squander it – for the advancement of our civilization and the betterment of society. I once heard, can’t remember from where, that the most effective poverty-reduction mechanism that mankind has ever seen is capitalism. Capitalism has raised the standards of living of more people than any other initiative and system before it – by a factor of many multiples.</p>
<p>As Warren Buffet said, the mere fact that we (able body entrepreneurs) won the ovarian lottery and were born to the right vagina comes with a certain amount of responsibility. Lady Luck (nothing we did to deserve it) allowed us to go to school, meet the right people, have access to information and resources – which hundreds of millions were not so fortunate. On top of that, we were given the ability to create companies that can create wealth for many shareholders, customers, clients &amp; employees. I believe, this obliges us to build the best businesses we can (grow as much as we can – not necessarily in terms of bulking up employee count, but grow revenues and profits). If we get an offer to sell, which could have a material impact on improving the financial security of said stakeholders, it should be seriously considered. Then do it again.</p>
<p>So, while I understand that they (Jason &amp; DHH) are basically pushing back against the Silicon Valley ethos of coming up with an idea, seeking VC money, hiring a bunch of people, selling to the biggest gullible buyer and then chilling on mojito island for eternity. I think they tend to be a BIT too overzealous with the opposite stance.</p>
<p>Aaron Patzer (of Mint fame) is now free to start a foundation and have a more significant impact on many lives, than he had before, all the while investing in other companies and starting another one for himself.</p>
<p>The fact that he can, and hundreds of millions can’t, I believe means he has a fundamental responsibility to maximize his capabilities as much as possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">Idea: Content Delivery Network powered by &#8216;opted-in&#8217; desktops - i.e. a legal botnet CDN.

This post was inspired by <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1033938" target="_blank">this comment on Hacker News</a>.

Explanation: CDNs now, are traditionally powered by data centers scattered all over the globe - that in many cases have edge networks where blade servers cache the most frequently requested content (i.e. content requested in the last 15-minutes). The good thing about this model, as opposed to downloading from a centralized server, is when you request content you can be downloading from the closest server to you - which results in faster download times.

The problem is that CDNs nowadays are still only able to have a handful of these datacenters all over the world. Some people estimate that Amazon (the great Amazon) only has data centers in <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2008/11/18/where-amazons-data-centers-are-located/" title="Data Center Knowledge - Amazon Data Center Locations" target="_blank">approximately 14 cities</a>. I know that many CDNs have arrangements with major ISPs to house local edge servers, so users that belong to those ISPs can get access to those data much quicker. That is a step in the right direction, in terms of reducing total amount of network hops to the source file, but can&#8217;t match the distribution network of an illegal P2P service.

Suppose when you wanted to download a large file, though, you could download it from everybody in your neighborhood - at the same time. This drastically changes the equation. That&#8217;s what P2P networks and clients kind of allow you to do. Even some games allow you to search for the closest server (hosted by an individual) to your IP.

So, back to the billion $$ idea. If you were able to create a CDN that distributed content (you would have to determine whether or not the content would be encrypted and the trade-offs therein) to a major network of peers all over the world. Think of a legal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet" title="Botnet - Wikipedia" target="_blank">botnet</a>. Not a spyware botnet, where users are tricked into installing &#8216;Anti-virus 2010&#8217;, but a network that people register to join and are paid per GB of disk storage and bandwidth used.

Let&#8217;s look at some math.

From the company&#8217;s perspective - using Amazon&#8217;s price sheet as benchmark (as of Jan 8, 2010):
<ul>
<li>Charge $0.15/GB for storage</li>
	<li>Charge $0.17/GB for bandwidth</li>
</ul>
For calculations sake, we are only going to use these figures. The calculations can also be applied to a graduated scale of bandwidth used and storage consumed - for the user.
<ul>
<li>Pay a peer $0.01/GB for storage</li>
	<li>Pay a peer $0.02/GB for bandwidth</li>
</ul>
<br><iframe scrolling="no" src="http://sheet.zoho.com/publish/marcamillion/cdn-worksheet" frameborder="0" height="400" width="500"> </iframe>

<br>
The main issues we can see with this model are that for the lower allocations of disk space - provided by the user - and slower internet pipes, the user takes home a pittance (approximately $4.83 for a 1mbit connection with 50GB storage space).  However, for more powerful connections with higher quantities of space, a user can be more than doubling or tripling the cost of their internet connection every month (<a href="http://marcgayle.com/2009/10/29/is-government-fiber-really-good-for-your-health/" title="$50 for 50mbit" target="_blank">with prices falling so rapidly, especially in the US</a>). With a 50mbit connection, and 50GB storage, a user can be taking home approximately $220 per month. Assuming 50mbit will be $50 throughout the US, following the <a href="http://marcgayle.com/2009/10/29/is-government-fiber-really-good-for-your-health/" target="_blank">lead of a town in Minneapolis</a>, they have quadrupled the cost of their broadband connection - assuming the CDN uses their connection for the amount of time they allocate it for (and also assuming their computer is left running 24x7).

Note: The Discount Factor in the spreadsheet model above is used to reflect the amount of time the user will allow the CDN to use their computer and bandwidth. So a 0.70 discount factor means that 70% of the time the CDN will have access to the users computer and bandwidth.

Just to do a quick comparison to the large CDNs (in terms of their cost structure), here is something to think about. As far as I can tell, the largest line item expenses that the &#8216;non-fibre-owning CDNs&#8217; have is the cost of bandwidth. Looking at Limelight Networks (<a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:LLNW&amp;fstype=ii" title="Limelight Networks " target="_blank">LLNW</a>), we see that their Cost of Revenue was approximately 64%. An unscientific comparison with the above model highlighted, shows our Cost of Revenue being 6.7% for storage, and 11.8% for bandwidth = approximately 18.5% of Revenues. Even if our model inputs were doubled ($0.02 for storage, $0.04 for bandwidth) cost of revenues would be approximately 37% (i.e. 50% lower than the traditional CDN).

The CDN business is a multi-billion dollar business. With a model like this, scaling becomes more of a software problem - than a hardware problem - which is a beautiful place to be. You scale on the backs of ISPs and users are responsible for maintaining their machines. It&#8217;s Google&#8217;s Adsense business model implemented as a CDN - in short.

Please feel free to tinker with the numbers, and leave comments for how I can improve the model.
