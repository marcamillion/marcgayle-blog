<p><span style="font-family: Palatino, Georgia, Baskerville, serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666; line-height: 18px;"> </span></p>
<p>I recently had a need for video compression software. I was working on a <a href="http://www.ideatin.com/" title="IdeaTin" style="color: #5f5f5f;">side project</a>, that involved compressing video and releasing it online.</p>
<p>I tried many different pieces of freeware and they all came up short. They were either too complicated, or didn’t quite do a good job. I settled on <a href="http://www.sorensonmedia.com/video-encoding/" title="Sorenson Squeeze 6" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">Sorenson Squeeze 6</a>. I have had experience with one of the earlier versions and remember it being pretty nice to use and the results were pretty good (i.e. relatively small size for high quality video).<span> </span></p>
<p>So I checked them out, being that it is a small project I was not on the market for anything TOO expensive. $800? No way. I continued searching for a free/cheaper alternative but with all the demos I downloaded, they always came up short. I decided to bite the bullet and get it.</p>
<p>Got it, worked beautifully. It’s an awesome product…really. It’s very intuitive, very powerful and has MANY settings. I used it for <a href="http://www.ideatin.com/" style="color: #5f5f5f;">IdeaTin</a> and decided that I should really get around to resizing all my home videos. Yes, all 700GB of them. Every single HD tape that I rip is about 30GB. I definitely don’t need ‘HD’ quality, but I never got around to figuring out how to reduce the size of my library. Now that I have Squeeze 6, I can finally tackle it in a sane way. To Sorenson’s credit, I emailed them telling them about my project and that the $800 price is too steep (also that I found Squeeze 6 at another online store for $200 cheaper). They refunded me $200 off the purchase price, no questions asked. I was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>I have a Windows 7 machine, 1 iMac + 1 Macbook Pro. The idea was that given the size of the library, I would have it running on all three machines at the same time to reduce the total amount of time spent re-encoding the library. Got it installed on the MBP and Windows 7 machine fine, no problems.</p>
<p>Tried to install on the iMac, no can do. Contact customer support, they say 1 Serial Number, 1 machine. Ok, I get such a policy in business environments (mid-size to large companies anyway).  I get it for Operating Systems, where it is the core of the system. The very foundation of the computer.</p>
<p>But for a home/small business, where people realistically own multiple machines, and for an application designed to do ‘heavy-lifting’ (where having multiple machines running at the same time will reduce the load) this policy should be re-evaluated. I get that there might be technical challenges with detecting who is telling the truth and who is trying to scam you, but I would be willing to bet that these types of policies turn off more legitimate users than deter pirates. If I were to pirate any software, I can install it on as many machines as I like. If it doesn’t work, I don’t have to use it and have no buyer’s remorse. If I buy software and it doesn’t do what I want, or there are restrictions (especially for the more expensive variety), having buyer’s remorse is the software company’s worst enemy.</p>
<p>In this case, Sorenson might be better served at least waving it for those that have a legitimate reason – what is the marginal cost of issuing one more serial number to someone that owns a small business or is using your software at home and has bought your software? Nothing. You don’t have to contact the customer, they will contact you. You don’t have to ship any new CDs or any new documentation. A simple email would suffice.</p>
<p>An alternative route that Sorenson could take is, build an ‘add-on’ application that comes with the software (free) for this particular use case. If you want to restrict me to just using it one or two machines, fine. But have an ‘applet’ that allows me to install a small app on additional computers that allow me to just do a single function (run batch encoding while the main machines are also running – or some variation thereof).</p>
<p>For all software makers out there, it might be beneficial in the short-term interest of the company to restrict the use of your software in ways YOU deem it appropriate to be used, but you simply risk diluting your brand equity in the long term. Imagine you buy a BMW and they tell you where you can drive it or who you can lend your car to.</p>
<p>Oh, and Sorenson, I know that when I bought your software I ‘agreed’ to these terms in the EULA. No need to throw it in my face when I am inquiring about them with your customer support. Your EULA should be protection against fringe cases, an escape of last resort. Not the first line of defense.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Marc,</p>
<p>Per your user agreement, you are only allowed one activation per license. If you would like more information on purchasing a license for multiple users, contact <a href="mailto:sales@sorensonmedia.com" style="color: #5f5f5f;">sales@sorensonmedia.com</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is to wishing that software companies will wise up and start allowing customers to do what they want with their software, once they take your money.</p>

<p>Say it ain&#8217;t so? As far as I know, I was never told that Blizzard would be using my bandwidth to serve other clients. I hope I didn&#8217;t miss it in the long EULA I skimmed over and agreed to.</p>
<p>As you can see in the image above, I am downloading Starcraft 2 Beta from a number of &#8216;peers&#8217;. I have a unique Peer ID (blacked out for privacy purposes), and each of my peers have the same. The leftmost column is the IP address for all the clients I am connected to, and the rightmost column is their Peer ID.</p>
<p>What is also curious is my download speed is only twice my upload speed. Sometimes it is even equal. It seems to me that Blizzard does this to keep as many peers as active as possible. There is no option to throttle my upspeed, or downspeed for that matter.</p>
<p>I love Blizzard and all, but these &#8216;sneaky&#8217;, old media, tactics are not befitting such a forward thinking company as Blizzard.</p>
<p>Perhaps this could have been buried in the EULA, and if that is the case, without any other notification, I feel&#8230;.kind of&#8230;taken advantage of.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Edit: Just re-read the EULA and saw point #3 which discusses this issue:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">3. Distribution of the Game. </span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Blizzard may choose to distribute the Game through the use of the &#8220;Blizzard Downloader&#8221; utility which utilizes the &#8216;upload&#8217; capability of your computer to distribute the Game to other participants of the Beta Test. In such an event, you agree that Blizzard may distribute the Game by using your home computer to &#8216;upload&#8217; all or part of the Game to other participants of the Beta Test.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Another particularly heinous section of their EULA is Ominously titled &#8216;Consent to Monitor&#8217;.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">8. Consent to Moniter.</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> WHEN RUNNING, THE GAME MAY MONITOR YOUR COMPUTER&#8217;S RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (RAM) FOR UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAMS RUNNING CONCURRENTLY WITH THE GAME.

IN THE EVENT THAT THE GAME DETECTS AN UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAM, THE GAME MAY (a) COMMUNICATE INFORMATION BACK TO BLIZZARD, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION YOUR ACCOUNT NAME, DETAILS ABOUT THE UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAM DETECTED, AND THE TIME AND DATE THE UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY PROGRAM WAS DETECTED; AND/OR (b)  EXERCISE ANY OR ALL OF ITS RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WITH OR WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE TO THE USER.</span></p>

  <div class="entry-content">Google just announced that they have rolled out a new indexing system for their search engine, called Caffeine.

Here are some interesting quotes:
<blockquote>Some background for those of you who don&#8217;t build search engines for a living like us: when you search Google, you&#8217;re not searching the live web. Instead you&#8217;re searching Google&#8217;s index of the web which, like the list in the back of a book, helps you pinpoint exactly the information you need. (Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.google.com/howgoogleworks/">good explanation</a> of how it all works.)</blockquote>
What&#8217;s even more intriguing is the amount of data they process:
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Caffeine lets us index web pages on an enormous scale. In fact, every second Caffeine processes hundreds of thousands of pages in parallel. If this were a pile of paper it would grow three miles taller every second. Caffeine takes up nearly 100 million gigabytes of storage in one database and adds new information at a rate of hundreds of thousands of gigabytes per day. You would need 625,000 of the largest iPods to store that much information; if these were stacked end-to-end they would go for more than 40 miles.</blockquote>
I can&#8217;t even fathom that amount of data.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many people misunderstand the true meaning behind &#8216;fail early, fail fast&#8217;. The most &#8216;high-profile&#8217; of which is <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1643-failure-is-overrated-a-redux" title="Failure is overated" target="_blank">Jason Fried</a> and our friends at <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2059-podcast-episode-4-jason-frieds-speech-at-big-omaha-2009" title="37 Signals Podcast discussing fail early fail often" target="_blank">37Signals</a>.</p>
<p>Fail early, fail fast isn&#8217;t encouraging you to fail. It&#8217;s encouraging you to act/move/start.</p>
<p>Read the phrase again, with emphasis: fail <strong>early</strong>, fail <strong>fast</strong>.</p>
<p>The idea behind the saying is, just do something. It&#8217;s easy to get trapped in a &#8216;secure&#8217; situation. Whether that is a &#8216;stable/cushy&#8217; job, or using a product that is OK. It&#8217;s this inertia that kills innovation. It&#8217;s fear of the unknown or fear of the failure that also dis-incentivizes people from striking out and making that killer product they have always envisioned, or recorded that song they have written, or sold that painting they have stashed away in their basement.</p>
<p>People get accustomed to procrastinating and delaying that they don&#8217;t attempt to do what they say they want to do.</p>
<p>The phrase &#8216;fail early, fail fast&#8217; is attempting to take the sting out of the fear of failing - by using the terms &#8216;early&#8217; &amp; &#8216;fast&#8217;. Makes it sound &#8216;quick&#8217; and &#8216;painless&#8217;. Ever been to a doctor to get an injection?</p>
<p>&#8216;It will feel like a mosquito bite&#8217; is what I am always told.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kinda like that - especially since creating a new product is so hard, the last thing a creator needs is the fear of failure hanging over their heads (although, to be fair that fear can be a good motivator).</p>
<p>I am not advocating failure, but anything that removes one more psychological barrier for inventors can only be good for society.</p>
<p>So, go ahead and fail as quickly as you can. Pick yourself up, and try again.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: Please note that I am not encouraging people to strike out in an attempt to fail. Simply to not be afraid of failing - if that wasn&#8217;t clear enough in the post.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently wrote a <a href="http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/letters/Mr-Seaga--take-a-lesson-from-PJ_7665365" title="Mr. Seaga take a lesson from PJ" target="_blank">letter</a> to the editor of one of the <a href="http://www.jamaicaobserver.com" target="_blank">local newspapers</a>, here in Jamaica.</p>
<p>The irony of it all, is that the way my letter was edited is that it can make me come across as politically divisive. That&#8217;s not what I meant. So, for all and sundry, here is the unedited version of my letter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr. Editor,</p>
<p>Shortly after President Obama took office, ex-Vice President Cheney did a major media blitz criticizing everything that the President did (keep in mind, that while he was VP, Cheney only spoke to the media a handful of times for his entire 8 years). Reporters were eagerly trying to get a comment from President Bush about the performance of Obama. He gave a response which surprised me. He said “I will give the current President the dignity of my silence”. Keep in mind this is after Obama basically won the elections on bashing Bush and tarnishing his legacy. This man, President Bush, took the moral high-ground of offering no critique.</p>
<p>Recently Mr. Seaga embarked on a similar media blitz, commenting on the joint Police/Military raid on Tivoli Gardens among other things. Some of his comments were, in my humble opinion, absolutely disappointing and potentially divisive. How dignified is it, for a former prime minister (of any party affiliation) to be criticizing the character of the current prime minister – in a relatively functional democracy? Can we have the former leader of the very party that Bruce Golding now chairs, coming out to bash him – even calling for his resignation?</p>
<p>This is not a debate of whether or not Mr. Golding should resign, but rather an analysis of key players in our young democracy.</p>
<p>If Mr. Seaga wants to comment on the state of the operations of Tivoli Gardens (given that he built it), I believe he has the right to do so. But, I would have hoped that, given Mr. Seaga’s political savvy, he would play the role of elder statesman, take the moral high-ground and refrain from commenting specifically on Mr. Goldings’ performance. That’s the job of the opposition, the media and the people. Perhaps Mr. Seaga can take a lesson from Mr. Patterson.</p>
<p>On another note, we have a recent column from Mervin Stoddart titled ‘Dudus is not the real enemy’, published by The Observer. I am disheartened that the publication of such vitriolic statements would be allowed, where he wrecklessly spews comments like ‘the economies of capitalistic exploiters’, ‘earth’s evil Caucasians’, and ‘Already their multinational corporations are raping all nations socio-economically’. It is about time we all acknowledge the power of words and be held to greater account.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree that some actions of the past, by large countries could be viewed as ‘taking advantage’ of other countries/people, but how does it help the current state of affairs – in a world where all countries have to work together for the betterment of all countries – to be promoting these notions? People can change and with change, enemies of the past can become partners of the future. Comments like those only help to further divide and polarize thereby making partnership and progress that much more difficult.</p>
<p>Perhaps we have all been indoctrinated with the misleading and very damaging maxim that ‘Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words will never hurt me’. That statement couldn’t be further from the truth. Words send nations to war, cause people to commit murder, give an entire generation hope, mobilize an entire society against a common enemy, spur donations of millions of dollars to ravaged states and even talk a suicidal jumper off the cliff. As a society, we all need to start being more mindful of the words that we use. Especially starting with our current leaders and former leaders.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the best use of words, is no use at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">Alexis your <a href="http://alexisohanian.com/an-open-letter-to-kevin-rose" title="An open letter to Kevin Rose from Alexis Ohanian" target="_blank">recent blog post to Kevin Rose re: Digg</a> struck a wrong chord with me. For those not familiar with what he is talking about, a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/28/exclusive-video-and-screenshots-of-digg-version-4/" title="Sneak Peak at Digg Version 4" target="_blank">new video giving details about upcoming changes for Digg version 4</a> was released today.<p></p>
I can see how on the surface these changes look like a clone of other more popular features, but I suspect you might be mis-interpreting what&#8217;s happening here.<p></p>
Yes, many of the features look and feel like competitors. But so does the iPod. It plays mp3s? Yuck! So does Rhapsody&#8217;s player, why would I want one from Apple. So does a Mercedes/BMW, it has wheels + an engine.<p></p>
The issue is the way it does what it does. I have not used it just yet, but from what I have seen, this could fundamentally be as much of a game changer as the first version of digg was to giving individual publishers a bigger voice.<p></p>
Imagine&#8230;now, as a publisher, I have 200 &#8216;followers&#8217; whose sole interest is in seeing the links/stories that I publish. <a href="http://mixergy.com/jason-fried-customers-clips/" title="Jason Fried on Mixergy" target="_blank">Jason Fried talks about building</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/5806452173" title="Jason Fried building an audience" target="_blank">an audience</a>. So far, there is no other tool that &#8216;aggregates&#8217; all your content and pushes it directly to an audience like digg v4 is suggested to do.<p></p>
People use Twitter to do this, but it wasn&#8217;t built to do that. It was built for messages of 140 characters. Valuable in it&#8217;s own right, but not as a &#8216;media publishing&#8217; tool. <p></p>
People use status updates on Facebook to do that, but it wasn&#8217;t made for that. It was made to update friends on your latest activities (i.e. uploaded new videos/photos, add new quotes, friended new people, got engaged/married&#8230;.other things that your social graph might find of value).
<p></p>But for publishers trying to build an audience, there isn&#8217;t one tool that allows an audience to &#8216;subscribe&#8217; to everything of interest to them.Yes, you can have a blog with an RSS feed. Your twitter feed has an RSS feed, etc. But RSS feed readers suck!
<p></p>The mere fact that I can have one place, that streamlines all of the links published by people I am interested in hearing from + links they found interesting, is absolutely game-changing (in my opinion).Ofcourse, it all comes down execution, but based on what I am seeing, I think I see Kevin back in his original form. Quite contrary to your assertion about pandering to his VCs, I don&#8217;t see any evidence of driving revenues. I see mainly product development. I see small UI elements that seem to enhance the link discovery process. I see giving value to small-time publishers and further &#8216;democratization&#8217; of news.
<p></p>So while I respect that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I would caution us all to wait and see how it unfolds, and actually use it - before casting judgement. Many <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/05/ive-changed-my-mind-about-the-ipad.html" target="_blank">high profile people have done that recently and have had to do mea cuplas</a>.<p></p>
Maybe I am biased, because I am one of those that submit stories that stall or get a handful of diggs. This looks like it could be a significant game changer for me. Maybe it won&#8217;t guarantee all my stories will make it to the front page, but I would not be surprised if my content got easily 200% - 800% more traffic, as a direct result of this change.
<p></p>THAT&#8230;would be game changing.
