			Google Indexes Hundreds of Thousands of Gigabytes Per Day</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		Google just announced that they have rolled out a new indexing system for their search engine, called Caffeine.

Here are some interesting quotes:
<blockquote>Some background for those of you who don&#8217;t build search engines for a living like us: when you search Google, you&#8217;re not searching the live web. Instead you&#8217;re searching Google&#8217;s index of the web which, like the list in the back of a book, helps you pinpoint exactly the information you need. (Here&#8217;s aÂ <a href="http://www.google.com/howgoogleworks/">good explanation</a> of how it all works.)</blockquote>
What&#8217;s even more intriguing is the amount of data they process:
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Caffeine lets us index web pages on an enormous scale. In fact, every second Caffeine processes hundreds of thousands of pages in parallel. If this were a pile of paper it would grow three miles taller every second. Caffeine takes up nearly 100 million gigabytes of storage in one database and adds new information at a rate of hundreds of thousands of gigabytes per day. You would need 625,000 of the largest iPods to store that much information; if these were stacked end-to-end they would go for more than 40 miles.</blockquote>
I can&#8217;t even fathom that amount of data.

To read the official Google announcement, check it out <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/our-new-search-index-caffeine.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

			Fail Early, Fail Fast Explained</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Many people misunderstand the true meaning behind &#8216;fail early, fail fast&#8217;. The most &#8216;high-profile&#8217; of which is <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1643-failure-is-overrated-a-redux" title="Failure is overated" target="_blank">Jason Fried</a> and our friends at <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2059-podcast-episode-4-jason-frieds-speech-at-big-omaha-2009" title="37 Signals Podcast discussing fail early fail often" target="_blank">37Signals</a>.</p>
<p>Fail early, fail fast isn&#8217;t encouraging you to fail. It&#8217;s encouraging you to act/move/start.</p>
<p>Read the phrase again, with emphasis: fail <strong>early</strong>, fail <strong>fast</strong>.</p>
<p>The idea behind the saying is, just do something. It&#8217;s easy to get trapped in a &#8216;secure&#8217; situation. Whether that is a &#8216;stable/cushy&#8217; job, or using a product that is OK. It&#8217;s this inertia that kills innovation. It&#8217;s fear of the unknown or fear of the failure that also dis-incentivizes people from striking out and making that killer product they have always envisioned, or recorded that song they have written, or sold that painting they have stashed away in their basement.</p>
<p>People get accustomed to procrastinating and delaying that they don&#8217;t attempt to do what they say they want to do.</p>
<p>The phrase &#8216;fail early, fail fast&#8217; is attempting to take the sting out of the fear of failing - by using the terms &#8216;early&#8217; &amp; &#8216;fast&#8217;. Makes it sound &#8216;quick&#8217; and &#8216;painless&#8217;. Ever been to a doctor to get an injection?</p>
<p>&#8216;It will feel like a mosquito bite&#8217; is what I am always told.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kinda like that - especially since creating a new product is so hard, the last thing a creator needs is the fear of failure hanging over their heads (although, to be fair that fear can be a good motivator).</p>
<p>I am not advocating failure, but anything that removes one more psychological barrier for inventors can only be good for society.</p>
<p>So, go ahead and fail as quickly as you can. Pick yourself up, and try again.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: Please note that I am not encouraging people to strike out in an attempt to fail. Simply to not be afraid of failing - if that wasn&#8217;t clear enough in the post.</em></p>

			Power of Words</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I recently wrote a <a href="http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/letters/Mr-Seaga--take-a-lesson-from-PJ_7665365" title="Mr. Seaga take a lesson from PJ" target="_blank">letter</a> to the editor of one of the <a href="http://www.jamaicaobserver.com" target="_blank">local newspapers</a>, here in Jamaica.</p>
<p>The irony of it all, is that the way my letter was edited is that it can make me come across as politically divisive. That&#8217;s not what I meant. So, for all and sundry, here is the unedited version of my letter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr. Editor,</p>
<p>Shortly after President Obama took office, ex-Vice President Cheney did a major media blitz criticizing everything that the President did (keep in mind, that while he was VP, Cheney only spoke to the media a handful of times for his entire 8 years). Reporters were eagerly trying to get a comment from President Bush about the performance of Obama. He gave a response which surprised me. He said âI will give the current President the dignity of my silenceâ. Keep in mind this is after Obama basically won the elections on bashing Bush and tarnishing his legacy. This man, President Bush, took the moral high-ground of offering no critique.</p>
<p>Recently Mr. Seaga embarked on a similar media blitz, commenting on the joint Police/Military raid on Tivoli Gardens among other things. Some of his comments were, in my humble opinion, absolutely disappointing and potentially divisive. How dignified is it, for a former prime minister (of any party affiliation) to be criticizing the character of the current prime minister â in a relatively functional democracy? Can we have the former leader of the very party that Bruce Golding now chairs, coming out to bash him â even calling for his resignation?</p>
<p>This is not a debate of whether or not Mr. Golding should resign, but rather an analysis of key players in our young democracy.</p>
<p>If Mr. Seaga wants to comment on the state of the operations of Tivoli Gardens (given that he built it), I believe he has the right to do so. But, I would have hoped that, given Mr. Seagaâs political savvy, he would play the role of elder statesman, take the moral high-ground and refrain from commenting specifically on Mr. Goldingsâ performance. Thatâs the job of the opposition, the media and the people. Perhaps Mr. Seaga can take a lesson from Mr. Patterson.</p>
<p>On another note, we have a recent column from Mervin Stoddart titled âDudus is not the real enemyâ, published by The Observer. I am disheartened that the publication of such vitriolic statements would be allowed, where he wrecklessly spews comments like âthe economies of capitalistic exploitersâ, âearthâs evil Caucasiansâ, and âAlready their multinational corporations are raping all nations socio-economicallyâ. It is about time we all acknowledge the power of words and be held to greater account.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree that some actions of the past, by large countries could be viewed as âtaking advantageâ of other countries/people, but how does it help the current state of affairs â in a world where all countries have to work together for the betterment of all countries â to be promoting these notions? People can change and with change, enemies of the past can become partners of the future. Comments like those only help to further divide and polarize thereby making partnership and progress that much more difficult.</p>
<p>Perhaps we have all been indoctrinated with the misleading and very damaging maxim that âSticks and stones can break my bones, but words will never hurt meâ. That statement couldnât be further from the truth. Words send nations to war, cause people to commit murder, give an entire generation hope, mobilize an entire society against a common enemy, spur donations of millions of dollars to ravaged states and even talk a suicidal jumper off the cliff. As a society, we all need to start being more mindful of the words that we use. Especially starting with our current leaders and former leaders.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the best use of words, is no use at all.</p>

			An Open Letter to Alexis Ohanian (Reddit Co-founder)</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		Alexis your <a href="http://alexisohanian.com/an-open-letter-to-kevin-rose" title="An open letter to Kevin Rose from Alexis Ohanian" target="_blank">recent blog post to Kevin Rose re: Digg</a> struck a wrong chord with me. For those not familiar with what he is talking about, a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/28/exclusive-video-and-screenshots-of-digg-version-4/" title="Sneak Peak at Digg Version 4" target="_blank">new video giving details about upcoming changes for Digg version 4</a> was released today.<p></p>
I can see how on the surface these changes look like a clone of other more popular features, but I suspect you might be mis-interpreting what&#8217;s happening here.<p></p>
Yes, many of the features look and feel like competitors. But so does the iPod. It plays mp3s? Yuck! So does Rhapsody&#8217;s player, why would I want one from Apple. So does a Mercedes/BMW, it has wheels + an engine.<p></p>
The issue is the way it does what it does. I have not used it just yet, but from what I have seen, this could fundamentally be as much of a game changer as the first version of digg was to giving individual publishers a bigger voice.<p></p>
Imagine&#8230;now, as a publisher, I have 200 &#8216;followers&#8217; whose sole interest is in seeing the links/stories that I publish. <a href="http://mixergy.com/jason-fried-customers-clips/" title="Jason Fried on Mixergy" target="_blank">Jason Fried talks about building</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/5806452173" title="Jason Fried building an audience" target="_blank">an audience</a>. So far, there is no other tool that &#8216;aggregates&#8217; all your content and pushes it directly to an audience like digg v4 is suggested to do.<p></p>
People use Twitter to do this, but it wasn&#8217;t built to do that. It was built for messages of 140 characters. Valuable in it&#8217;s own right, but not as a &#8216;media publishing&#8217; tool. <p></p>
People use status updates on Facebook to do that, but it wasn&#8217;t made for that. It was made to update friends on your latest activities (i.e. uploaded new videos/photos, add new quotes, friended new people, got engaged/married&#8230;.other things that your social graph might find of value).
<p></p>But for publishers trying to build an audience, there isn&#8217;t one tool that allows an audience to &#8216;subscribe&#8217; to everything of interest to them.Yes, you can have a blog with an RSS feed. Your twitter feed has an RSS feed, etc. But RSS feed readers suck!
<p></p>The mere fact that I can have one place, that streamlines all of the links published by people I am interested in hearing from + links they found interesting, is absolutely game-changing (in my opinion).Ofcourse, it all comes down execution, but based on what I am seeing, I think I see Kevin back in his original form. Quite contrary to your assertion about pandering to his VCs, I don&#8217;t see any evidence of driving revenues. I see mainly product development. I see small UI elements that seem to enhance the link discovery process. I see giving value to small-time publishers and further &#8216;democratization&#8217; of news.
<p></p>So while I respect that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I would caution us all to wait and see how it unfolds, and actually use it - before casting judgement. Many <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/05/ive-changed-my-mind-about-the-ipad.html" target="_blank">high profile people have done that recently and have had to do mea cuplas</a>.<p></p>
Maybe I am biased, because I am one of those that submit stories that stall or get a handful of diggs. This looks like it could be a significant game changer for me. Maybe it won&#8217;t guarantee all my stories will make it to the front page, but I would not be surprised if my content got easily 200% - 800% more traffic, as a direct result of this change.
<p></p>THAT&#8230;would be game changing.
