			Self-Doubt: The Unspoken Truth of Founding a Startup</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div>Founding a startup has been a dream of mine, for as long as I can remember. I methodically went about learning as much as I could about what it took to build a company from nothing to a going concern.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I don&#8217;t remember the exact moment (I was between 8 - 10 years old though) when I realized that in order to build a business, I had to come up with an idea first. Ever since then I conditioned myself (almost literally) to constantly come up with ideas. So much so that I became the annoying sibling/son/friend that always had a new idea. Luckily for me, I have another friend that was just as prolific, probably even more prolific, at coming up with ideas as I did [wassup Simms :)]. When I was ridiculed, I wasn&#8217;t the only one receiving it. As a result of that, I have learned to speak less, and do more. I only share with a select few (my poor wife has to bear it all the time - for better or worse, right ?).</div>
<p> </p>
<div>But somewhere along the way, I realized that there is more to building a successful business than coming up with an idea. So I set out to do everything I could to learn about business and startups before jumping into mine. For instance:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I have read every single <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham essay</a>
</li>
<li>Subscribed to <a href="http://www.inc.com/">Inc. magazine</a> for three to four years while I lived in the US - read each issue cover to cover for my entire subscription.</li>
<li>Subscribed to <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com">Entrepreneur magazine</a> and did the same.</li>
<li>Read most of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Problem-Solution/dp/1430210788/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305354762&amp;sr=8-1">Founders at Work</a> by Jessica Livingston (Paul Graham&#8217;s wife)</li>
<li>Read books/articles/stories about many tech founders from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Semiconductor">Fairchild Semiconductor</a> to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/">Facebook</a>. I know many of them by name and obscure facts about many of them, e.g. Apple had <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-06-07/business/ct-biz-0607-wayne--20100607_1_iphone-steve-wozniak-apple-i-computer">three co-founders</a> (not just two), etc.</li>
<li>Convinced I was going to do a tech startup, I did my undergrad degree in Computer Science and did my MBA with a concentration in Finance (finance is the life blood of every company, right?) after.</li>
<li>I love economics, finance, and all that good stuff. I day traded currencies for a while. I understand markets - supply &amp; demand and the battle between Capital &amp; Labor.</li>
<li>I know all the startup theory - <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startups</a>, <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/what-is-customer-development.html">Customer Development</a>, etc.</li>
<li> I have decent-ish karma on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>.</li>
<li>I worked with a startup company for a while, and understand the internal struggles of having to produce a lot with very minimal resources.</li>
<li>Once I finally decided to take the plunge and do my startup I <a href="http://blog.compversions.com/learning-ruby-on-rails-css-jquery-building-a">taught myself all the programming</a> I need to know to build the product I wanted to build.</li>
<li>I finally launched and got a good reception from <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2460406">many</a> <a href="http://forrst.com/posts/Bootstrapped_10_months_Learned_Rails_Finally-LHf#comment-land">quarters</a>. People like what they see. Had a few bugs, but have squashed most of the ones brought to my attention so far, and making good progress on the rest.</li>
</ul>
<div>Now what? Now I have to go and sell it. Oh Crap! </div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>This is where the self-doubt kicks in.</strong></div>
<p></p>
<div>Sure, I spoke to a bunch of people before building it. I validated the idea and I knew that this was a particular problem, because I experienced the pain and I know others that had this problem too. But now&#8230;..now I have to collect money from people. People I don&#8217;t know, and who don&#8217;t know me.</div>
<p></p>
<div>The transition from hardcore development to sales/marketing has been a tough one for me. I think I underestimated the mental switch needed to jump from one to the other. Especially since I don&#8217;t have the luxury of having someone else carry on with the development while I do the sales. If I do nothing, nothing happens. Knowing that, makes the self-doubt worse. But, it also makes it better. Because I know that if I do nothing, nothing happens. So I have to do something, so I end up doing something.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Self-doubt, when you are doing this for the first time (or second, third or fourth time) is perfectly normal. That&#8217;s how it is when you are just learning to ride, drive, fly or anything else new.</div>
<p></p>
<div>The trick is to persevere, because the only way to become confident in your abilities and be successful is to push through the doubt and get better little by little.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So stop distracting yourself with Hacker News, TechMeme, TechCrunch or any other activity/site you use as an excuse to escape the doubt you feel when you think about what you have to do.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Take a deep breath, and push through.</div>
<p></p>
<div>As the saying goes&#8230;Keep Calm, Carry On.</div>
<p></p>

			An Open Letter to Larry Page</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Mr. Page,</p>
<div>      Good morning. It is a new day.</div>
<p></p>
<div>You have sent shock waves through the blogosphere and the internet industry <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704503104576250691188026066.html" target="_blank">by your recent moves</a>. </div>
<p></p>
<div>Google has much potential, and a lot of latent assets waiting to be successfully monetized. I know it is hard to see the forest from the trees - especially when you are locked in a media &#8216;battle&#8217; with Facebook. Now is your opportunity to re-invent Google and not let Google be the next Microsoft.</div>
<p></p>
<div>The first step is to realize which business you are in, and which business you SHOULD be in.</div>
<p></p>
<div>You have been in the advertising business. That has subsidized your investment in your greatest asset - and possibly the greatest re birthing the tech industry has ever seen (if you jump on the opportunity that is).</div>
<p></p>
<div>You should be in the infrastructure business. Yes, like Amazon is. <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/" target="_blank">Rackspace</a>. As technology progresses, more and more people are going to have the need to create all sorts of services. Companies like Amazon, Heroku, Rackspace have lowered the bar for us to get started. You have toyed with the idea with AppEngine, but let&#8217;s face it, you haven&#8217;t given it much attention.</div>
<p></p>
<div>The market desperately wanted a successful &#8216;GDrive&#8217;, but you let Dropbox <a href="http://digg.com/news/technology/Dropbox_GDrive_Killer_finally_launches_plus_Linux_iPhone" target="_blank">steal your thunder</a>.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So now is your chance. Continue to use advertising to subsidize the monetization of those assets - but don&#8217;t be fooled by trying to compete with Facebook. That ship has sailed ages ago.</div>
<p></p>
<div>The real arms race is in Infrastructure-as-a-Service. </div>
<p></p>
<div>If you don&#8217;t move now, I suspect that Mr. Zuckerberg will beat you there too. He has already showed inklings of this, with Facebook Credits, and the Platform. </div>
<p></p>
<div>They have also more recently started showing off their <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2011/04/16/photo-tour-of-facebooks-new-datacenter/" target="_blank">sexy infrastructure</a>. The day FB decides to start monetizing that infrastructure, like Amazon did, I think it might be too late for you.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Please don&#8217;t let that happen.</div>
<p></p>
<div>We (the Internet) are still rooting for you. You are quickly becoming the underdog again.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Just don&#8217;t get too wrapped up in the current skirmishes, that you forget the real war.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Sincerely,</div>
<div>

			Henry Paulson&#8217;s Pay Cut</a>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class="gmail_quote">Here is a letter I wrote to the editor of The Economist recently (published on April 14, 2011), regarding Hank Paulson&#8217;s &#8220;pay cut&#8221;</div>

That may be true from a nominal perspective, however Mr Paulson saved $50m in capital-gains taxes because of a law passed by George Bush senior that exempts capital gains incurred by those selling investments to move into the public sector. He was also able to dump all securities shortly before the financial system imploded (without regulators or shareholders causing a fuss), so it was more like early retirement on the back of an extremely prudent financial decision than a pay cut.</p> <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 20px;"> Marc Gayle<br>Kingston, Jamaica</p>

			How Do You Get Good at Anything ?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div>John Gruber said something in a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/04/cutting_that_cord">recent article</a> about Apple that really jumped out at me.</div>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<div>Making money is not easy. Apple has gotten good at making large profits every quarter by building up to that — making ever-increasing profits all along, quarter after quarter after quarter, device after device after device.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>This was in reference to a quote by Jason Fried in an Inc. article about <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110301/making-money-small-business-advice-from-jason-fried_Printer_Friendly.html">how to get good at making money</a>.</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div>I can’t say enough about bootstrapping. Whether you’re starting your first business or your next one, my advice is to bootstrap it. Bootstrapping forces you to think about making money on Day One. There’s a fundamental difference between a bootstrapped business and a funded business. It’s all about which side of the money you’re on. From Day One, a bootstrapped business has no choice but to make money. There’s no cushion in the bank and not much in the pockets. It’s make money or go home. To a bootstrapped business, money is air.</div>
<p></p>
<div>On the other hand, from Day One, a funded business is all about spending money. There’s a pile in the bank, and it’s not there to collect interest. Your investors want you to hire, invest, and buy. There’s less — and in some cases, no — pressure to make money. While that sounds comforting, I think it ultimately hurts. It replaces the hustle, the scrap, the fight, with a false comfort of “we can worry about that later.”</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>As Gruber pointed out, this is painfully obvious, it almost bears not saying but it is so easy to miss. The way to get good at something is to do it. Over, and over, and over again. Keep doing it.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Whether it is painting, playing the violin, singing, learning a foreign language or programming language, hiring, firing, presenting, public speaking, cooking, writing, reading, cleaning, or farming.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Anything you want to get good at, you have to do it. Over, and over, and over, and over again. This kinda jives with what Malcolm Gladwell had <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/outliers/outliers_excerpt1.html">proposed</a> in his book Outliers.</div>
<p></p>
<div>We sometimes forget, so I figured I would repeat it.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Besides, I want to get better at writing so might as well be &#8216;meta&#8217; while doing that eh ? </div>

			The YC Dilemma - Thoughts About YC Reject</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div>Paul Graham likes to say that the most important quality of a founder that they (YC) is looking for is determination&#8230;aka being <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html">Relentlessly Resourceful</a>.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Well, one of the things that have always struck me about <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">YC</a>&#8217;s selection process, is that they are almost self-selecting for a 50:50 success rate (success in the sense of picking the winners).</div>
<p></p>
<div>I am not saying that 50% of their companies will go bust, but given that we know that at least 1,000 applied to the batch before the last one (can&#8217;t find reference, but it&#8217;s out there somewhere), and YC only chose 40+, there is a high likelihood that the rejection will be a catalyst to many companies to prove YC + team wrong. Even if just 0.5% of those rejected (950) are the ones that prove them wrong, that&#8217;s still about 45 companies.</div>
<p></p>
<div>If those 45 companies turn out to be &#8216;significant misses&#8217; on YC&#8217;s part, that works out to about a 50:50 success ratio (where they successfully only chose 50% of likely successful companies from the entire batch).</div>
<p></p>
<div>However, given those odds, don&#8217;t just assume that because 950 startups were rejected - the most successful of those will migrate to YC Reject and as such YC Reject will be as successful as YC. But it is possible that YC Reject could tap into that latent pool of PG&#8217;s ideal candidates that were somehow missed by PG himself.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Could the next <a href="http://www.heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>, <a href="http://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, <a href="http://www.airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> come from <a href="http://www.ycreject.com" title="YC Reject" target="_blank">YC Rejects</a> and not YC itself ?</div>
<p></p>
<div>Interesting times ahead.</div>

			How to Change Root Route Behavior in Rails 3</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>These instructions have only been tested with declarative_authorization. So while it may work with other authorization gems, I haven&#8217;t tested it so can&#8217;t verify. </p>
<p>Say you want your users to see your marketing site (when they try to go to yourapp.com) when they are not logged in, but when they are logged in, you want them to see something different (like the dashboard of your app - which is found by going to your home controller, and index action - &#8216;home#index&#8217;), how do you do this in Rails 3? </p>
<p><br>If you put an index.html file in your public directory, that takes precedence over everything else. Rails routing doesn&#8217;t even execute when that file is included (as far as I understand it anyway). So, you do it like this: In your routes.rb file, change your root route to the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/869820">https://gist.github.com/869820</a></p>
<p><br>Rename your &#8216;public/index.html&#8217; file to some other name, e.g. &#8216;public/marketing.html&#8217;. In your home controller, do this:</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/869828">https://gist.github.com/869828</a></p>
<p>Now, when a user is not logged in, they will be redirected to your static marketing page. But when they are logged in, they will go to your dashboard at home#index. Hope that helps you.</p>

			Ikea Type Furniture Focused on Comfort (Non-Tech Startup Idea)</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div>This is an idea that I have had for a while, and have said that I am going to pursue one day. But being real with myself, there are many other ideas I have that I will execute before I get around to this one.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So here goes.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Furniture at the same price points as Ikea&#8217;s furniture (or in the similar range), but rather than focusing on the look - you focus on the feel. Put a lot of focus on the comfort that whoever is sitting on your furniture feels. </div> <p></p>
<div>The reason I haven&#8217;t done it, is because it is capital intensive. You have to either be a furniture maker that can make this stuff yourself, or have a ton of cash to invest in building the perfect first line of furniture - which is going to go through many permutations and a lot of wasted cash.</div> <p></p>
<div>The end product should be plush, and feel heavenly to sit down on/in. It should be assemble-able and deliver-able just like Ikea&#8217;s furniture, for a similar price point. Make sure that you don&#8217;t compete on price with anyone else, and you focus on quality of the comfort. People will pay for comfort - see the success of Tempurpedic, Lay-Z-Boy, et. al. Make sure your margins are fat enough to keep you in business for a long time.</div> <p></p>
<div>You should also have at least one flagship store that is the &#8216;Apple Store&#8217; equivalent of &#8216;Comfortable Furniture&#8217;. You have to invest heavily in the feeling that the customer feels when they walk in the store.</div> <p></p>
<div>To that end, the killer name for such an endeavor: Cloud 9. </div>
<p></p>
<div>Imagine when they walk into the store, they are &#8220;Stepping onto Cloud 9&#8221;. Make sure that both the store and the product live up to that expectation.</div> <p></p>
<div>If you do decide to run with it, please don&#8217;t do it tackily. Do it properly and execute like Steve Jobs or Ikea would.</div>
<p></p>
<div>This is an idea I have held close to my heart for many years, and hope that by releasing it someone can run with it successfully.</div> <p></p>
<div>This is not a &#8220;quick flip&#8221; type of business idea, but definitely a long-term wealth generation type of idea. </div>

			Github&#8217;s Brilliant Organic Traffic Acquisition Strategy</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div>In three words: free public accounts.</div>
<p></p>
<div>If you Google any of the following terms, there is a high probability that a link to Github will be on the first page of the SERPs:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Diaspora (as in the Facebook competitor)</li>
<li>html5-boilerplate (this might be a bit specific, but you get the idea)</li>
<li>Homebrew (i.e. for OS X)</li>
<li>Active Merchant</li>
<li>jQuery (actually page 2 for me)</li>
</ul>
<div>Granted, all of these terms are very developer-centric - but that&#8217;s the brilliance of their strategy. Their target market is developers. So in a virtuous circle, when they provide free accounts to open-source projects that naturally are very popular not only are they loosely affiliated with that project, but they get all of the organic search engine traffic for the terms associated with those projects. The people that find them, will typically be developers that will become paying customers of Github - and those developers are likely to put up public repos that generate organic traffic to github on all sorts of obscure long-tail keywords.</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>I always thought that it was because Github wanted to be affiliated with these high profile projects (i.e. have them put a link to github on their project page, etc.). It never occurred to me that the bigger benefit is the massive organic search engine traffic that they likely get as a result of this strategy.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Brilliant Github. Brilliant!</div>

		<div>Amazon, </div>
<div>        I love what you have done with turning basic web services (most recently <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ses/pricing/" target="_blank">sending batch emails</a>) into a -pay-as-you-go Utility.</div>
<p></p>
<div>But really, you need to simplify your dashboard and reporting. </div>

<div>Do you seriously expect me to not be confused by this one menu - not to mention it is one of 4 and the others are almost equally as daunting.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Help me help you. I want to continue using your services, but if your interface continues being like this and Apple moves in - unfortunately you will turn into the &#8216;ex&#8217;.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So before that happens, don&#8217;t give them the opportunity. Spend some money on a great design team to simplify this and present it easily.</div>

			How Dropbox Is Printing Money</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<div><em>Quick Disclaimer: I don&#8217;t work for Dropbox and don&#8217;t know anybody that does. I have no inside knowledge, but just based on my following them and putting things together, this is my interpretation of how they are printing money.</em></div>
<p></p>
<div>This might get a bit complicated, but follow me for a second. </div>
<p></p>
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TL DR Version</span></strong></div>
<p></p>
<div>
<strong> </strong>Dropbox stores only 1 copy of every unique file and serves everybody the same unique file - provided that it is the exact file - but charges everybody for the full file size. E.g. if 1 person uploads a 5MB file, but 99 other people upload it too, they don&#8217;t have 100 copies of that 5MB file for 500MB of storage. The only use 5MB of storage, but charge everybody&#8217;s quota of 500MB.</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Long Version</span></strong></div>
<p></p>
<div>At first glance, when you think about Dropbox&#8217;s cost structure, it seems sub-phenomenal. It seems ok. Just like any other &#8216;infrastructure as a service&#8217; where their Gross Profit Margins (i.e. Gross Profits after Cost of Goods Sold is paid from Revenues) are about 70% - 85% depending on who you believe.</div>
<p></p>
<div>But I am going to demonstrate that it could be higher than we have ever seen for any other type of service.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So let&#8217;s get to a little math, and a few assumptions.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Let&#8217;s say that everybody on Dropbox that has a paid account is maximizing the space they are alloted. The reason we are assuming this is so that we can see how the model looks in the &#8216;worst case&#8217; scenario - which is no doubt what any conservative/responsible entrepreneur should be looking at. If someone is paying for storage they are not using, that&#8217;s pure profit - so that will add to the attractiveness of the model. </div>
<p></p>
<div>Let us say that Dropbox is paying $0.15/GB (which I know they are not because they are using A LOT of storage, but I will address that later).</div>
<p></p>
<div>So paid users pay $10/mo for 50GB storage. That means, Dropbox&#8217;s cost for that account is 50GB X $0.15/GB = $7.50. </div>
<p></p>
<div>At first blush, that seems HORRIBLE. Dropbox&#8217;s Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is 75% of their revenues? <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:WMT&amp;fstype=ii">Walmart</a> - a retail company that you expect to have a very high cost of revenue based on their low cost model - has COGS of 75% (according to the latest fiscal year, their revenues were $405B with COGS of $304B, so 304/405 = ~75% . So you mean to tell me that Dropbox has the same business model as Walmart? Yuck!!</div>
<p></p>
<div>However, let&#8217;s factor in the fact that Dropbox gets the best publicly available rate from Amazon for storage at $0.055/GB. What does their COGS look like now?</div>
<p></p>
<div>50GB X $0.055/GB = $2.75. Ok, that&#8217;s a bit better. But that is still COGS of 27.5%. Seems a bit high for &#8216;SaaS&#8217; services. </div>
<p></p>
<div>
<a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:CRM&amp;fstype=ii">Salesforce</a> has COGS of 19.75% of Revenue for their last fiscal year - $257.93M/$1,305.58M = 19.75%.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So even for a SaaS business that looks high.</div>
<p></p>
<div>We have seen <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/20/dropbox-4-million-user/">story</a>, after <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5956/5-Viral-Marketing-Lessons-From-Dropbox.aspx">story</a>, about how Dropbox is <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2009/11/25/fast-growing-sync-service-dropbox-reveals-6m-of-new-ish-funding/">growing at a phenomenal rate</a>. To date, Dropbox has only announced <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/dropbox">$7.5M in financing</a> (according to Crunchbase). </div>
<p></p>
<div>Dropbox has 6M users, approximately, and supposedly <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-much-storage-does-Dropbox-use">uses a TON of storage</a>. So their monthly Amazon bill must be ginormous&#8230;.or is it?</div>
<p></p>
<div>According to <a href="http://files.dropbox.com/u/2/app.html">Drew Houston&#8217;s Y Combinator Application</a>:</div>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana; border-collapse: collapse;">Dropbox is kind of like taking the best elements of subversion, trac and rsync and making them &#8220;just work&#8221; for the average individual or team. Hackers have access to these tools, but normal people don&#8217;t.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana; border-collapse: collapse;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">A Diff, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff" target="_blank">computer terms</a> is:</span></span></div>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana; border-collapse: collapse;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">In computing, diff is a file comparison utility that outputs the differences between two files. It is typically used to show the changes between one version of a file and a former version of the same file.</span></span></div>
</blockquote>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">Arash, was recently <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/01/24/dropbox-founder-on-new-features-and-global-expansion/" target="_blank">interviewed by The Next Web</a>, this is what he had to say that piqued my interest:</span></div>
<p></p>
<div>
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;"> </span>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; color: #3d3d3d; line-height: 22px;">When I asked Ferdowsi which feature on Dropbox he likes that is underused he told me about the Undelete feature:</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> <span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: 14px; color: #5b5b5b; font-style: italic; line-height: 22px;">“Anytime a file is deleted on your Dropbox or a file is changed, Dropbox records a snap shot and stores it. So you can go back to any point. If you’re a free user you can go back 30 days. If you’re a paid user you can go back to unlimited revisions. So it’s cool to know you can go back to a file you deleted 2 years ago”.</span>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;"> </span>
<div>Think about that for a second, on top of having higher than normal COGS for a SaaS app - they also offer a substantial free service (2GB  + 250MB per referral up to 4/5GB) and they offer &#8216;undelete&#8217; where the files of free users are stored for 30 days and paid users forever. This one little feature is mindblowing. Because what that essentially means is that everybody can have unlimited storage for just $10/mo. How do you ask? Well, say you have 50GB of stuff uploaded in month 1. You delete 45GB and upload a new 45GB. If you ever want anything from the first 45GB, all you have to do is delete enough space in your current 50GB and restore that portion. So say you want 5GB that were delete from month 1, all you do is delete 5GB in month 2 and restore that set from month 1, then you can delete the newly restored data and restore month 2 data when you are done. If you do this perpetually, obviously it will be annoying - but in theory, someone could have unlimited storage forever for only $10/mo.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So that puts a spin on this model. Given that people decided to do that, if Dropbox paid for every GB it sold, it would be bankrupt VERY quickly. Because they are storing 100GB for a user that is only paying for 50GB. </div>
<p></p>
<div>So this is where the printing money comes in.</div>
<p></p>
<div>What they do, I think because it has not been told to me and I know no one that works there, is they store only 1 copy of a file that is uploaded that has never been uploaded before (i.e. they check makeup of the file, using something like the diff utility that I defined earlier) and then serve that 1 file to everybody that requests that file. Don&#8217;t believe me? Download a popular file that many people would likely download - e.g. <a href="http://download.services.openoffice.org/files/extended/iso/en/OOo_3.2.1_Win_x86_install_20100609.iso" target="_blank">Open Office for Windows</a> (note that download will start) - and put it in your dropbox folder. See how long it takes to upload. Mine just took less than 1 minute, and that&#8217;s a 241MB file. Could it be that your internet speed is so fast that it uploads the entire file in a minute or two - or is there something else happening behind the scenes?</div>
<p></p>
<div>I suspect the latter.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So my theory is this, they take the first unique copy of every file (i.e. the identical file) and store that one. They then simply have a pointer to that file in everybody else&#8217;s folder. So whenever anybody wants to share it, they send them the pointer to that 1 file and don&#8217;t create a copy. So in theory, when 1 person uploads a 5MB file, and 99 other people upload that same file - they simply create pointers (or an index) for those 100 people and have the 1 file stored. So they store only 5MB + whatever small size the pointers/index come up to, but they &#8216;charge&#8217; the quota of those 100 people for a total of 500MB. Essentially they charge for 500MB but only use 5MB. </div>
<p></p>
<div>Network effects apply here, in that the more people upload to the system, is the lower their costs become over time. Because they keep charging additional people for access to the same content. So there could conceivably be the cases where people are paying for 50GB storage, and Dropbox is paying nothing for that particular 50GB because they are using files that are already on the server. It&#8217;s hard to calculate the COGS in this scenario because there are so many variables - but I have no doubt that it is lower than regular SaaS (because the average SaaS service pays for every GB their user uses).</div>
<p></p>
<div>That&#8217;s the theory in a nutshell. Needless to say, as Dropbox grows their profits will just grow because there will be more files indexed and more people paying for those single files. They just have to pay for the transfer - which is minimal since most people are not accessing most files many times per month - and they can get the best rates because of growing economies of scale.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I hope no one misinterprets this as an attack on Dropbox, but rather a post of adulation. I love it. This business model is truly gold.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I don&#8217;t think it is hyperbole to say that I haven&#8217;t encountered any other business model that produces as much profit as this one. It combines the best elements of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking" target="_blank">fractional reserve banking</a>, SaaS cost structures and low-cost viral marketing.</div>
<p></p>
<div>If this is what they are doing, Drew Houston, Arash and the rest of the Dropbox team should be bought drinks. Because they just figured out how to print money legally.</div>
<p></p>
<div>If they are not doing this, they should buy me a drink for showing them how to print money legally :)</div>
