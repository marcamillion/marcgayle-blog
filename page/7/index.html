			The Sheer Power of the US Military</a>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nostri-imago/2888359817/"></a>We all know that the US military is powerful, but I think it is easy to underestimate exactly how powerful they really are.  US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was recently giving a speech at the Eisenhower Library on the 65th anniversary of the allied victory in Europe. He was pitching the case for cutting down the size of the defense budget, and addressing the concerns of many that America will lose it&#8217;s strength if defense spending is overhauled. He was quite confident that that wasn&#8217;t the case. Here is a choice excerpt (note, I added the emphasis):</p>
<blockquote>Finally, this Department’s approach to requirements must change.  Before making claims of requirements not being met or alleged “gaps” – in ships, tactical fighters, personnel, or anything else – we need to evaluate the criteria upon which requirements are based and the wider real world context.  For example, should we really be up in arms over a temporary projected shortfall of about 100 Navy and Marine strike fighters relative to the number of carrier wings, when America’s military possesses more than 3,200 tactical combat aircraft of all kinds? Does the number of warships we have and are building really put America at risk <strong>when the U.S. battle fleet is larger than the next 13 navies combined, 11 of which belong to allies and partners</strong>?  <strong>Is it a dire threat that by 2020 the United States will have only 20 times more advanced stealth fighters than China</strong>?</blockquote>
<p>I am a military geek, so these numbers didn&#8217;t entirely startle me, but it did give me pause.  To read the entire speech, <a href="http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1467" title="Robert Gates Speech at Eisenhower Library" target="_blank">check it out here</a>.  Upon reading this speech, it reminded me of an article that The Economist published some time ago. Choice excerpts are as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">THE Perseus, a 900kg (2,000lb) bomb made in Greece, incinerates almost everything in an area larger than a dozen football fields. Farther out, oxygen is sucked from the air and people may be crushed by a pressure wave. The inferno is similar to that caused by napalm—a jellied-petrol explosive heavily restricted by a United Nations weapons convention.</blockquote>
<p>That was just the prelude. Here is a much more impressive excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>On April 2nd 2003, during the second Gulf war, a hundred or so Iraqi armoured vehicles approached a far smaller American reconnaissance unit south of Baghdad. Responding to a call for help, a B-52 bomber attacked the first 30 or so vehicles in the column with a single, historic pass. It dropped two new CBU-105 bombs, and the result shocked the soldiers of both sides—and, soon enough, military observers everywhere.</div>
<p></p>
<div>While falling, the CBU-105 bombs popped open, each releasing ten submunitions which were slowed by parachutes. Each of these used mini rockets to spin and eject outward four discs the size of ice-hockey pucks.</div>
<div>The 80 free-falling discs from the pair of bombs then scanned the ground with lasers and heat-detecting infra-red sensors to locate armoured vehicles. Those discs that identified a target exploded dozens of metres up. The blast propelled a tangerine-sized slug of copper down into the target, destroying it with the impact and the accompanying shrapnel. The soldiers in the 70 vehicles farther back in the column surrendered immediately.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>If I were in those vehicles with the Iraqi soldiers, I would most definitely surrender after witnessing that.</div>

Boston Big Picture</a> has the best photo journal I have ever come across. It is one of the many reasons I love the internet, technology and photography. At no other time in history, could I sit 5,000 miles away from a place and see such rich representations in such a timely manner – almost instantly nowadays.</p>
<p>They recently published, essentially, the state of Afghanistan in April 2010 in Pictures. Below you will find some of my favorites.</p>

The truth is, I saw the name of their latest article and didn’t even see the pictures, but I knew I had to write a post about it. They are always that awesome, that I never pre-screened it and picked the images as I went along. I had to restrain myself from including more from the post, because there are so many awesome ones.</p>

</div>
I am sick, and tired, of <a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/authorMaterialInfo.html?mid=2334" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">hearing the</a> <a href="" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">constant</a> <a href="http://davidcancel.com/advice-for-recent-mba-grads/" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">bashing</a> <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1112-the-mba-myth" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">of MBAs</a> (on that last link, see the comments of the post…not so much the post itself).
<p>Yes, I get it. Many folks with MBAs did leave their ‘Ivy League’ school for outrageously high paying jobs in finance on Wall Street and ostensibly cause the financial crisis of 2008. Yes, I get that many of them actually invented the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation" title="Collaterized Debt Obligations" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">CDO</a>s that were at the heart of the melt down.</p>
<p>Yes, I get that some MBAs leave school with a superiority complex and tend to abuse their privileged positions of management – by either being incompetent or abusive or worse both.</p>
<p>Yes, I get that many created dot-bombs in the 90s with the expressed purpose of just raising money in the boom boom days, and hiring ‘lowly developers’ to create their star product and go public.</p>
<p>Yes, I get that many VCs and finance guys have MBAs and have become the scorn of the entrepreneur. Yes, I get that VCs have abused their power which bred resentment.</p>
<p>I get all of that.</p>
<p>But when did wrong begett wrong? When did it become acceptable to paint with a broad brush and label all MBAs as the cliche’d stereotype?</p>
<p>It is very disappointing to see many people, within the tech industry, that I have previously looked up to make such a mistake as generalizing.</p>
<p>Saying that MBAs are not a good fit for startups, is like saying that doctors, lawyers, teachers are not good for startups. What rubbish is that?</p>
<p>I am a geek, by almost any standard, but I also love business. After completing my CS degree, I decided to go to Business School because I figured it couldn’t hurt. Guess what, it turned out to be the best decision of my life.</p>
<p>Separate and apart from the core business analytical skills it taught me – i.e. statistics, how to read company financials in &amp; out, the fundaments of economics (micro and macro), etc. – more importantly it taught me what it is like to work in teams, constantly. Many times under severe pressure with looming deadlines and a ridiculous amount of work. It taught me how to deal with that nimrod on my team that doesn’t know how to communicate and how to do simple tasks that any high school grad should be able to do. It taught me how to step up to the plate when there is a leadership vacuum and everyone else on the team is afraid (including myself) of the large task ahead. It taught me how to step back when there are too many leaders and know when to follow when someone is better fit in a situation than I am.</p>
<p>It taught me how to encourage strengths and replace weakness on a team. It taught me how keep track of key milestones, deliverables and the likes, to get to a key goal on time. It taught me how to negotiate (with teachers, other students, administrators, bosses, financiers). It taught me how to be resourceful in finding the funding to complete my education when in the last two semesters, my main source of funding dries up at the beginning of what we now know is the Great Recession.</p>
<p>It gave me a passion for economics and finance. It taught me about the VC side of the transaction (how to run a VC firm and what they are looking for) if I am ever looking for financing. It taught me about free markets (both their perils and wonderful advantages). It taught me how to balance all of the above while working part-time (remotely) and being married (and going through a pregnancy and first year of my child’s life).</p>
<p>All of which I am certain will help me in all ventures I pursue in the future (not just startup opportunities – but non-profit teams I will be a part of, any political organizations I join, sports team I coach, etc.). It has drastically changed my world view, and I am all the more grateful for it – especially when I watch the news and see all the shenanigans going on and understand what is happening – knowing when the politicians (on both sides of the aisle) are simply playing games and misleading the public.</p>
<p>So yes, we MBAs have been jerks in the past. I apologize on their behalf. But, I beg of you…please…please…let’s stop with the hasty generalizations and the MBA bashing. Time to put that meme to rest.</p>

			Greece Debt Crisis Explained - Part Two</a>

</div>
In the first part of this series about <a href="http://marcgayle.com/2010/05/07/greece-debt-crisis-explained-part-one/" title="Greece Debt Crisis Explained - Part One" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">the Greece crisis</a>, we looked at the causes of crises in general and some of the elements that led to Greece’s crisis specifically.</span></p>
<p>The single most important factor in financial markets is confidence. Confidence in everything. From the political system to strength of the local currency to regulators to central bankers. In October 2009, the new Greek Prime Minister shattered market confidence by announcing that several revisions have to be made on their reported numbers (i.e. they have been lying) starting with the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2009/10/22/afx7033114.html" title="Greece Lied" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">budget deficit being double previous estimates</a> @ 12.5% of GDP. As a result of that announcement, which was the absolute right thing for the new Prime Minister to do, the credit ratings agencies <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2009/10/22/afx7033114.html" title="Fitch downgrades Greece debt" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">downgraded</a><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8426085.stm" title="Greece downgraded by all three rating agencies" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">Greece’s debt</a>.</p>
<p>The new Greek government kept dithering about whether or not they need assistance. To further compound the issue, the EU and IMF were back and forth about whether or not they <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a4vrygzcbJbk" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">would come to Greece’s rescue</a>. The first version of the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article7060757.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000" title="25 Billion Euro Greek Bailout Plan" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">bailout plan was only 25 Billion Euros</a>. Even when this was presented, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-31/greece-may-be-heading-back-to-square-one-on-aid-as-bonds-fall.html" title="Markets fall on $25B bailout package" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">the markets were still not convinced</a> that everything would be ok. EU leaders and the IMF were forced to go back to the drawing board and come up with a more ‘potent’ solution. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-05-02/greece-bailout-plan-includes-support-fund-for-country-s-banks.html" title="$147B bailout package agreed" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">A $147B bailout</a> package was put together, that seems to have <a href="http://www.salon.com/wires/techbiz/2010/04/11/D9F1AEK00_world_markets/" title="Stocks higher on Greece bailout plan" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">soothed markets fears</a> about Greece’s problems. However, the steep austerity measures demanded by the IMF and the EU didn’t sooth the<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/05/04/greece.bailout.protests/index.html" title="Greeks protest austerity measures by IMF" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">fears of the Greeks</a> who will have to pay dearly for the years of profligacy by their elected officials.</p>
<p>Just when things were being contained in Greece, S&amp;P downgraded <a href="http://www.whtc.com/news/articles/2010/apr/27/sp-downgrades-portugal-two-notches/" title="S&amp;P downgrades Portugal" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">Portugal</a> &amp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2010/04/28/general-eu-europe-financial-crisis_7558663.html?boxes=Homepagebusinessnews" title="S&amp;P downgrades Spain" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">Spain’s</a> debt. This causes panic among investors as <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/fundsNews/idINN2823961120100428" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">stock markets</a> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100428-716525.html?mod=WSJ_World_MIDDLEHeadlinesEurope" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">all over the world</a> start to decline. The EU is forced back into a corner, and has no choice but to fight. Come out swinging they did. The EU leaders, IMF and the US put together a <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/37061547" title="Trillion dollar european bailout" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">$1 Trillion bailout package</a> for <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/10753330/1/cramers-mad-money-recap-europe-bailouts-the-real-deal-final.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEN" title="Trillion dollar bailout for Europe." target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">all troubled Euro nations</a>.</p>
<p>So, in summary…we have seen a small country that first ‘needed’ a $25B bailout, turn into a large $1T bailout for the entire EU (basically). What exciting times we live in. If it is one thing these regulators seem to have learned, it is that fear and uncertainty can spread <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_Financial_Crisis" title="Asian financial crisis" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">contagion all over</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American_debt_crisis" title="Latin American debt crisis" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">world in no-time flat</a>. They seem to have tried to get in front of it this time. Although…there are <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world_business/view/1055982/1/.html" title="Euro down on trillion dollar bailout" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">early signs that there are still doubts</a>. Hopefully, this is another crisis diverted.</p>

Inspired by <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1325747" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">this question at Hacker News</a>, I decided to write a series of posts about the Greece Debt Crisis (as I understand it anyway). Hopefully this is helpful to someone, and if you have any particular questions or sections of the crisis that you would like me to try and explain please feel free to let me know in the comments.

<p><strong>What causes a government debt crisis?</strong></p>
<p>Typically, governments carry a certain amount of debt on their books as standard operating procedure. These are in the form of bonds. A ‘normal’ amount of between 20% – 65% is usually fine, for most countries. This actually works well, because when the fiscal situation of the government is in good order (i.e. when the government is earning enough to cover the interest on the debt + invest in infrastructure and projects that produce growth) the government is actually doing investors a huge service by providing a ‘risk-free’ asset for them to include in their diversified portfolios. The crisis comes about when the government’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio" title="Debt to GDP Ratio - Wikipedia" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">debt-to-GDP</a> ratio reaches to dangerous levels (usually 120%+) and the fundamentals of their fiscal situation becomes shaky. i.e. either GDP growth slows/stops, revenue measures are inadequate (taxpayers avoid paying their fair share by bribing officials), spending gets wildly out of control, or any combination of the three. The result of this is that the ability for the government to honor their interest payments becomes in jeopardy.</p>
<p><strong>What caused Greece’s debt crisis?</strong></p>
<p>So Greece, unfortunately, has a combination of those factors. According to <a href="http://www.mnec.gr/export/sites/mnec/en/economics/greek_economy_prospects/FactSheet_January07_Eng.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">Greece’s Ministry of Finance</a> (PDF), up to 2007 Greece had GDP growth rates of between 2.5% and 5% from 1996 – 2006. However, as later posts will show, it is important to note that perhaps those GDP growth figures are now to be taken with a grain of salt – as it has been revealed that previous administrations have been ‘cooking the books’. The following image shows a nice comparison of Greece and the rest of the EU during that period:</p>

</div>
According to the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html" title="Greece: CIA World Factbook" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">CIA World Factbook</a>, Greece had estimated GDP growth rates in the latter years of 4% in 2007, 2% in 2008 and -2% in 2009. So while growth has slowed significantly over the years, given that we just came out of a severe fiscal crisis, those numbers don’t look that bad. However, when we look at their other measures we can see the crisis intensifying. Eurostat, an EU agency, <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-22042010-BP/EN/2-22042010-BP-EN.PDF" title="Eurostat: Greece budget deficit revised" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">recently put out a report</a> (PDF) that paints a damning picture of the Greece fiscal situation.
<p>From the report, one of the things they show are the levels of government revenues (as % of GDP) and government expenditures from 2006 – 2009. This is what it says:</p>
<p>Gov. Expenditures: 2006 = 43.2% of GDP; 2007 = 45%; 2008 = 46.8%; 2009 = 50.4%;</p>
<p>Gov. Revenues: 2006 = 39.3% of GDP, 2007 = 39.7%; 2008 = 39.1%; 2009 = 36.9%;</p>
<p>You can generally see that the trend should be reversed. The expenses should be going down, while income goes up! The increasing expenses can be attributed to generally powerful labor unions, and free-wheeling politicians that promise more than they probably should.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>We have seen, in Part One, that the fundamentals of the Greek economy started to falter before the economic crisis hit. In other parts we will dive deeper into what caused the sudden surge in anxiety and possible contagion effects. If you have any questions that you would like me to address, please feel free to let me know in the comments section below. I have a general guide of what I want to cover, but I am fairly flexible.</p>

</div>

<p>The Wall Street Journal recently had an article about the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704388304575202413074193720.html?mod=WSJ_article_MoreIn" title="Fed preparing to sell mortgages" target="_blank">Fed getting ready to start off-loading the $1.1T worth</a> of mortgages they bought during the crisis (in an attempt to save the banks).</p>
<p>From the article (note, I added emphasis):</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>At $1.1 trillion in holdings of mortgage debt guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, the Fed owns roughly a fifth of all these outstanding instruments.</p>
<p>Some Fed officials are pushing for a more aggressive approach. In April, Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, called for <strong>monthly sales of $15 billion to $25 billion</strong> to eliminate the Fed’s mortgage holdings <strong>within five years</strong>. “It is likely the Fed will have to sell a nontrivial amount of its MBS holdings,” he concluded. Some Fed policy makers—among them Charles Plosser of Philadelphia, Jeffrey Lacker of Richmond and Kevin Warsh at the Fed board—are sympathetic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first glance, so much money has been thrown around in the media that 1.1 Trillion Dollars seems like it’s not so big. To put it into perspective, let’s look at some prospective buyers and see how much they would be able to buy and how long they would last:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:BRK.A&amp;fstype=ii" title="Berkshire Hathaway Financials" target="_blank">Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A)</a> – According to Google Finance, Warren Buffet’s investment company had approximately $30.5B in cash and short-term equivalents at the end of the last fiscal year. Assuming they have the same amount of cash (which is probably inaccurate, but just simplifying), and also assuming that Warren Buffet wanted to buy as many mortgage backed securities from the Federal Reserve as he could get his hands on, and also assuming that he was prepared to use all of his cash to do so…he could only participate in a maximum of 2 months (let’s call it 1.5months) worth of sales by the Fed – before he runs out cash. So that’s one large investment company down, with only 58.5 months of sales to go.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:GS&amp;fstype=ii" title="Goldman Sachs Financials" target="_blank">Goldman Sachs (GS)</a> –  had approximately $38.21B in cash and short-term equivalents. So they would be able to participate for 2 months. So only 56.5 months to go.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.pionline.com/article/20100308/CHART2/100309910" title="The Largest Hedge Funds in the World" target="_blank">The largest hedge funds in the World</a> – with total assets under management of approximately $530B, if they were able to ‘magically’ liquidate their holdings and purchase from the fed…that entire process would take between 21.2 – 35.33 months. So only 25 more months to go (assuming some middle ground between both values is chosen).</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:GOOG&amp;fstype=ii" title="Google financials" target="_blank">Google (GOOG)</a> – had $24.5B cash on hand. So they can play ball for approximately 1 month.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:MSFT&amp;fstype=ii" title="Microsoft Financials" target="_blank">Microsoft (MSFT)</a> – had $31B cash…so they can last 1.5 months as well.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:KO&amp;fstype=ii" title="Coca-Cola Financials" target="_blank">Coca-Cola (KO)</a> –    Only has $9B, so they can’t even sit at the table and participate (again, this assumes one company per month, to get the shortest time of getting rid of the mortgages as possible).</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:AAPL&amp;fstype=ii" title="Apple Financials" target="_blank">Apple (AAPL)</a> – Has $24B, so they can participate for 1 month.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only 21.5 more months to go.</p>
<p>I know this is a major simplification, it’s just an interesting exercise to look at. Especially in this media climate with hundreds of zeroes thrown all over the place. Also note that I have not included large pension funds, retirement schemes, etc. that typically have very large wads of cash…mainly because those funds tend to be abstract to most people. When you see companies constantly in the news, it’s easier to visualize how big the Fed’s balance sheet is.</p>
<p>Hope that puts it into perspective.</p>
<p>Another thing I have been thinking about lately, is the part of the proposal that will regulate the financial industry (I am pro reform) that creates a ‘bailout kitty’. i.e. the liabilities of large financial institutions will be taxed and stored in this kitty. What I am wondering is this: Where will that money be invested and who will manage it? If they (the managers of said kitty) ‘play it safe’ by investing in sovereign debt, which country’s debt? Won’t that create some perverse incentive for countries to keep running fiscal deficits because they have a literal ‘large pot of gold’ sitting down at their disposal that will allow them to finance any program they want to finance? i.e. moral hazard of the political sort.</p>
<p>Not saying the liabilities shouldn’t be taxed, and the kitty not created…just saying…it might have unintended consequences that are not currently being discussed. However, that might be the subject of another post.</p>

			App Idea for the iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p></p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<img alt="Scratch__win_app_idea" height="375" src="/marcgayle-blog/images/2010/04/23/iphone-and-ipad-app-idea/scratch__win_app_idea.jpg" width="500">
</div>

<p><strong>Idea: </strong>Scratch and win.</p>
<p><strong>Concept: </strong>Give consumers free stuff (on a very consistent basis) and give advertisers more brand engagement. Think <a href="http://www.woot.com/" title="Woot" target="_blank">woot.com</a> but with free, quality, stuff (or actually even deeply discounted – per the coupon in the win).</p>
<p><strong>Existing Competitors:</strong> <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scratch-off-now/id358970551?mt=8">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scratch-off-now/id358970551?mt=8</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.scratchoffnow.com">www.scratchoffnow.com</a></p>
<p>That’s the idea in a nutshell. Here are some more details:</p>
<p>This app would be free in the App Store. Naturally, this idea would work best with folks that have existing relationships either with an ad agency (or agencies) or with brands and other advertisers.</p>
<p>The graphics would be holding a simple coin, and you use your real finger to scratch the ticket with the coin.</p>
<p>Game mechanics could be included, so points could be accumulated that users can redeem for some discounts (think Visa, American Express, Airlines, etc. kind of points).</p>
<p>The trick is to start with a bang, say giving away 500 – 1,000 iPads in the first 48 hours.</p>
<p>Then, once you have the momentum going you continue to provide small wins for the users even when they don’t ‘win’ a major prize (supplied by a vendor or brand).</p>
<p>The app can even be branded (charge for impressions above the results of the prize, or the prize itself is sponsored by some other brand).</p>
<p>Build functionality to allow users to ‘share points’ with others. Add a social aspect to it, so I can send 1,000 points to my sister so she can do whatever she wants with it.</p>
<p>Integrate it with Facebook Game Developers (like <a href="http://www.zynga.com/" title="Zynga: Facebook Game Developer" target="_blank">Zynga</a>) where points and ‘tickets’ are hidden in the games – work out some sort of kickback commission with them. This can also be extended to other game platforms – like <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml" title="World of Warcraft" target="_blank">World of Warcraft</a>, <a href="http://www.heyzap.com/" title="HeyZap" target="_blank">HeyZap</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Implement scavenger hunts for ‘golden tickets’, where each ticket is a guaranteed prize – this comes back to the game mechanics idea earlier.</p>
<p>That’s all I can think of right now, and many people might ask…why don’t I do it. Well, to be honest, I am quite busy right now and I am not a big fan of the advertising model (i.e. working with brands and advertisers…it’s just not my forte. I am not bashing it…just saying it’s not my thing).</p>
<p>Hope this sparks some ideas and someone wants to run with it, that would be awesome. I would definitely download the app (provided it can work on my iPod Touch 2Gen).</p>
<p>You are free to take the idea and run with it. If you do run with it, some credit would be nice <img class="wp-smiley" src="http://marcgayle.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" style=""></p>
<p>I have some additional ideas on other possibilities, so if you would like me to be involved in any way, <a href="http://marcgayle.com/contact/" title="Contact Marc Gayle" target="_blank">feel free to reach out to me</a>. You don’t have to…just saying.</p>
