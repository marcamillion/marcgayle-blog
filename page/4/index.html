  <div class="entry-content"><div><em>Quick Disclaimer: I don&#8217;t work for Dropbox and don&#8217;t know anybody that does. I have no inside knowledge, but just based on my following them and putting things together, this is my interpretation of how they are printing money.</em></div>
<p></p>
<div>This might get a bit complicated, but follow me for a second. </div>
<p></p>
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TL DR Version</span></strong></div>
<p></p>
<div>
<strong> </strong>Dropbox stores only 1 copy of every unique file and serves everybody the same unique file - provided that it is the exact file - but charges everybody for the full file size. E.g. if 1 person uploads a 5MB file, but 99 other people upload it too, they don&#8217;t have 100 copies of that 5MB file for 500MB of storage. The only use 5MB of storage, but charge everybody&#8217;s quota of 500MB.</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Long Version</span></strong></div>
<p></p>
<div>At first glance, when you think about Dropbox&#8217;s cost structure, it seems sub-phenomenal. It seems ok. Just like any other &#8216;infrastructure as a service&#8217; where their Gross Profit Margins (i.e. Gross Profits after Cost of Goods Sold is paid from Revenues) are about 70% - 85% depending on who you believe.</div>
<p></p>
<div>But I am going to demonstrate that it could be higher than we have ever seen for any other type of service.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So let&#8217;s get to a little math, and a few assumptions.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Let&#8217;s say that everybody on Dropbox that has a paid account is maximizing the space they are alloted. The reason we are assuming this is so that we can see how the model looks in the &#8216;worst case&#8217; scenario - which is no doubt what any conservative/responsible entrepreneur should be looking at. If someone is paying for storage they are not using, that&#8217;s pure profit - so that will add to the attractiveness of the model. </div>
<p></p>
<div>Let us say that Dropbox is paying $0.15/GB (which I know they are not because they are using A LOT of storage, but I will address that later).</div>
<p></p>
<div>So paid users pay $10/mo for 50GB storage. That means, Dropbox&#8217;s cost for that account is 50GB X $0.15/GB = $7.50. </div>
<p></p>
<div>At first blush, that seems HORRIBLE. Dropbox&#8217;s Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is 75% of their revenues? <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:WMT&amp;fstype=ii">Walmart</a> - a retail company that you expect to have a very high cost of revenue based on their low cost model - has COGS of 75% (according to the latest fiscal year, their revenues were $405B with COGS of $304B, so 304/405 = ~75% . So you mean to tell me that Dropbox has the same business model as Walmart? Yuck!!</div>
<p></p>
<div>However, let&#8217;s factor in the fact that Dropbox gets the best publicly available rate from Amazon for storage at $0.055/GB. What does their COGS look like now?</div>
<p></p>
<div>50GB X $0.055/GB = $2.75. Ok, that&#8217;s a bit better. But that is still COGS of 27.5%. Seems a bit high for &#8216;SaaS&#8217; services. </div>
<p></p>
<div>
<a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:CRM&amp;fstype=ii">Salesforce</a> has COGS of 19.75% of Revenue for their last fiscal year - $257.93M/$1,305.58M = 19.75%.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So even for a SaaS business that looks high.</div>
<p></p>
<div>We have seen <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/20/dropbox-4-million-user/">story</a>, after <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5956/5-Viral-Marketing-Lessons-From-Dropbox.aspx">story</a>, about how Dropbox is <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2009/11/25/fast-growing-sync-service-dropbox-reveals-6m-of-new-ish-funding/">growing at a phenomenal rate</a>. To date, Dropbox has only announced <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/dropbox">$7.5M in financing</a> (according to Crunchbase). </div>
<p></p>
<div>Dropbox has 6M users, approximately, and supposedly <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-much-storage-does-Dropbox-use">uses a TON of storage</a>. So their monthly Amazon bill must be ginormous&#8230;.or is it?</div>
<p></p>
<div>According to <a href="http://files.dropbox.com/u/2/app.html">Drew Houston&#8217;s Y Combinator Application</a>:</div>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana; border-collapse: collapse;">Dropbox is kind of like taking the best elements of subversion, trac and rsync and making them &#8220;just work&#8221; for the average individual or team. Hackers have access to these tools, but normal people don&#8217;t.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana; border-collapse: collapse;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">A Diff, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff" target="_blank">computer terms</a> is:</span></span></div>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana; border-collapse: collapse;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">In computing, diff is a file comparison utility that outputs the differences between two files. It is typically used to show the changes between one version of a file and a former version of the same file.</span></span></div>
</blockquote>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">Arash, was recently <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/01/24/dropbox-founder-on-new-features-and-global-expansion/" target="_blank">interviewed by The Next Web</a>, this is what he had to say that piqued my interest:</span></div>
<p></p>
<div>
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;"> </span>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; color: #3d3d3d; line-height: 22px;">When I asked Ferdowsi which feature on Dropbox he likes that is underused he told me about the Undelete feature:</span></blockquote>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;"> <span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: 14px; color: #5b5b5b; font-style: italic; line-height: 22px;">“Anytime a file is deleted on your Dropbox or a file is changed, Dropbox records a snap shot and stores it. So you can go back to any point. If you’re a free user you can go back 30 days. If you’re a paid user you can go back to unlimited revisions. So it’s cool to know you can go back to a file you deleted 2 years ago”.</span>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;"> </span>
<div>Think about that for a second, on top of having higher than normal COGS for a SaaS app - they also offer a substantial free service (2GB  + 250MB per referral up to 4/5GB) and they offer &#8216;undelete&#8217; where the files of free users are stored for 30 days and paid users forever. This one little feature is mindblowing. Because what that essentially means is that everybody can have unlimited storage for just $10/mo. How do you ask? Well, say you have 50GB of stuff uploaded in month 1. You delete 45GB and upload a new 45GB. If you ever want anything from the first 45GB, all you have to do is delete enough space in your current 50GB and restore that portion. So say you want 5GB that were delete from month 1, all you do is delete 5GB in month 2 and restore that set from month 1, then you can delete the newly restored data and restore month 2 data when you are done. If you do this perpetually, obviously it will be annoying - but in theory, someone could have unlimited storage forever for only $10/mo.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So that puts a spin on this model. Given that people decided to do that, if Dropbox paid for every GB it sold, it would be bankrupt VERY quickly. Because they are storing 100GB for a user that is only paying for 50GB. </div>
<p></p>
<div>So this is where the printing money comes in.</div>
<p></p>
<div>What they do, I think because it has not been told to me and I know no one that works there, is they store only 1 copy of a file that is uploaded that has never been uploaded before (i.e. they check makeup of the file, using something like the diff utility that I defined earlier) and then serve that 1 file to everybody that requests that file. Don&#8217;t believe me? Download a popular file that many people would likely download - e.g. <a href="http://download.services.openoffice.org/files/extended/iso/en/OOo_3.2.1_Win_x86_install_20100609.iso" target="_blank">Open Office for Windows</a> (note that download will start) - and put it in your dropbox folder. See how long it takes to upload. Mine just took less than 1 minute, and that&#8217;s a 241MB file. Could it be that your internet speed is so fast that it uploads the entire file in a minute or two - or is there something else happening behind the scenes?</div>
<p></p>
<div>I suspect the latter.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So my theory is this, they take the first unique copy of every file (i.e. the identical file) and store that one. They then simply have a pointer to that file in everybody else&#8217;s folder. So whenever anybody wants to share it, they send them the pointer to that 1 file and don&#8217;t create a copy. So in theory, when 1 person uploads a 5MB file, and 99 other people upload that same file - they simply create pointers (or an index) for those 100 people and have the 1 file stored. So they store only 5MB + whatever small size the pointers/index come up to, but they &#8216;charge&#8217; the quota of those 100 people for a total of 500MB. Essentially they charge for 500MB but only use 5MB. </div>
<p></p>
<div>Network effects apply here, in that the more people upload to the system, is the lower their costs become over time. Because they keep charging additional people for access to the same content. So there could conceivably be the cases where people are paying for 50GB storage, and Dropbox is paying nothing for that particular 50GB because they are using files that are already on the server. It&#8217;s hard to calculate the COGS in this scenario because there are so many variables - but I have no doubt that it is lower than regular SaaS (because the average SaaS service pays for every GB their user uses).</div>
<p></p>
<div>That&#8217;s the theory in a nutshell. Needless to say, as Dropbox grows their profits will just grow because there will be more files indexed and more people paying for those single files. They just have to pay for the transfer - which is minimal since most people are not accessing most files many times per month - and they can get the best rates because of growing economies of scale.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I hope no one misinterprets this as an attack on Dropbox, but rather a post of adulation. I love it. This business model is truly gold.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I don&#8217;t think it is hyperbole to say that I haven&#8217;t encountered any other business model that produces as much profit as this one. It combines the best elements of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking" target="_blank">fractional reserve banking</a>, SaaS cost structures and low-cost viral marketing.</div>
<p></p>
<div>If this is what they are doing, Drew Houston, Arash and the rest of the Dropbox team should be bought drinks. Because they just figured out how to print money legally.</div>
<p></p>
<div>If they are not doing this, they should buy me a drink for showing them how to print money legally :)</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div>As a consumer of services offered by both of Jamaica&#8217;s largest banks, it pains me to deal with the little things that the banks take for granted.</div>
<p></p>
<div>For instance, look at how they quote the currency exchange rates.</div>
<p></p>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NCB</span></div>
<p></p>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<img alt="Ncb-fx_rates" height="334" src="/images/2010/12/07/ui-tip-for-jamaican-banks/NCB-FX_Rates.png" width="445">
</div>
<br></span></div>
<p></p>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bank of Nova Scotia Jamaica (BNS JA)</span></div>
<p></p>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<img alt="Bns-ja-fx_rates" height="408" src="/images/2010/12/07/ui-tip-for-jamaican-banks/BNS-JA-FX_Rates.png" width="500">
</div>
<br></span></div>
<p></p>
<div>This always confuses me. What do these rates mean? Who is doing the buying and selling?</div>
<p></p>
<div>A simple tip, that will get rid of ambiguity adding the word &#8220;You&#8221;, or &#8220;We&#8221;. So it reads &#8220;You Buy (Cash)&#8221;, &#8220;You Buy (CHQ)&#8221;, &#8220;You Sell&#8221;.</div>
<p></p>
<div>You (the bankers) have to remember that you guys are the experts. You guys get these quotes in real-time and update them many times throughout the day. To you, it is abundantly clear what these rates mean.</div>
<p></p>
<div>To &#8216;John Public&#8217;, that does an FX transaction once a month or once a few weeks or once a few months, we don&#8217;t have time to memorize how you are portraying this. Every time I come to one of these charts I say to myself &#8220;Which vantage point are they giving me this information from again? Is it mine, or theirs?&#8221;. Then I remember that it is yours, and that just seems selfish.</div>
<p></p>
<div>At the end of the day, it&#8217;s not about you&#8230;it&#8217;s about your customer.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Who cares what you buy and sell FX for? What we (your customers) care about is how much WE will pay, and how much WE will get if we sell to you. </div>
<p></p>
<div>You are welcome :)</div>

  <div class="entry-content">Patrick McKenzie was able to avoid <a href="http://marcgayle.com/startups-death-death-from-1000-cuts">death by 1,000 cuts</a> by finally launching. From one hacker to another&#8230;congratulations.<p></p>
<div>Appointment Reminder, not only has a pretty descriptive and unambiguous app name - which is awesome - but allows you (as a business owner that relies on booking clients for appointments - i.e. doctors, dentists, etc.) to <a href="https://www.appointmentreminder.org/">easily setup automated appointment reminders for your customers</a>, and gently reminds them via a phone call or text message. Do check it out, you can even <a href="https://www.appointmentreminder.org/a/calendar">try a free demo</a>.</div> <p></p>
<div><a href="https://www.appointmentreminder.org"><img title="billboard.jpg" src="https://www.appointmentreminder.org/wp-images/billboard.jpg" alt="billboard.jpg"></a></div>
<p></p>
<div>Congrats again Patrick.</div> <p></p>
<div>I wish you all the best.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You hardly ever hear of a startup that just goes *poof* one day and suddenly implodes. The more common occurrence are a series of bad decisions by management and/or the founders. This also applies to larger companies too.</p>
<p></p>
<div>One of the things I have encountered while building <a href="http://www.compversions.com">Comp Versions</a> is that it is easy to become overwhelmed by the amount of work ahead of you. Especially when it is now common mantra to get something out as quickly as possible.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Even more especially when you have to be learning programming as you go along, are doing it by yourself and bootstrapping - talk about bad odds.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Although I have completed a major milestone (the majority of the Rails back-end is done), I have now started the front-end. </div>
<p></p>
<div>Let me tell you, it is quite daunting when I look at my stylesheet and it is ~600 lines long, and I know that I still have about 80% of the application left of the front-end to complete.</div>
<p></p>
<div>This is further compounded when I spend an entire day (or two days) being stumped by some alignment issues of <li> items. Although, I must confess, once I complete that it feels SOOO good and there are cumulative effects - i.e. I will never have that problem again, and the issue is fixed everywhere else in the app that is needed. </li>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Each of these &#8216;stumpings&#8217; is a cut. If I let this cut stop me, or conquer me, I am doomed to give up. In the cumulative, I am quite scarred (note: not &#8216;scared&#8217;) at the moment and I know I will be further scarred in the weeks ahead.</div>
<p></p>
<div>But I have no choice but to get out my box of band-aids and press ahead.</div>
<p></p>
<div>This is one of the reasons why many people recommend going all-in (i.e. quitting your day-job, and giving up everything else). When you are all-in, each cut is a milestone. </div>
<p></p>
<div>So don&#8217;t look at it like I am one more cut closer to quitting, but rather - one more cut closer to the 1,000 before I get to launch.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So here is to about 450 more.</div>
<p></p>
<div>You should <a href="http://www.twitter.com/marcgayle" title="Marc Gayle on Twitter" target="_blank">follow me</a> on twitter.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div>After watching an interview with Jason Calacanis, I can safely say that I would never want to work for him, and never want to model my company to be anything remotely like his. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am not knocking Jason personally, I just think his work values are wack. Correction, I think his values (or those that I can see by his public persona) are wack.</div>
<p></p>
<div>There I said it.</div>
<p>
<object height="300" width="500">
<param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/KmWiYx3qL2U?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US">

</p>
<div>In a world that is flat, where the best technical talent can go anywhere, who on earth would want to go and work for a company whose CEO specifically states that he has no interest in employees that want &#8216;balance&#8217;. Talk about a shitty job experience. </div>
<p></p>
<div>The worst part about all of this, is that I am yet to see Jason produce the &#8216;high quality&#8217; product that his supposed &#8220;abnormal&#8221; (his words, not mine) work ethic produces. Perhaps that&#8217;s valuable in journalism where you have to fight for the best leads to break the best stories - so I can see how that MIGHT be applicable at Weblogs, Inc. but even that is pushing it.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Jason also equated not wanting to sell your soul and work 80 hour weeks to being &#8216;normal&#8217;, i.e. it&#8217;s not exceptional and you don&#8217;t produce outstanding results being &#8216;normal&#8217;. </div>
<p></p>
<div>I guess when you have F U money, you really can say and do anything without caring about the repercussions, but I don&#8217;t think Jason realizes that the best leaders inspire (not intimidate). </div>
<p></p>
<div>I am yet to hear of anyone &#8216;brag&#8217; that they work at Mahalo. All the instances I have seen of people discussing their jobs at Mahalo, it has usually been followed with &#8216;&#8230;.yeah&#8230;I know&#8217;.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I am still in disbelief that he really believes this.</div>
<p></p>
<div>But&#8230;I guess, coming from the guy that thought he could pay for Digg&#8217;s top users, it isn&#8217;t much of a shock.</div>
