  <div class="entry-content"><div>I have heard how Tim Ferris has used A/B testing to test headlines for his first book, and how he used the blogosphere to create groundswell for the 4-Hour Workweek. However, I just realized another strategy he used for 4-Hour Body.</div>
<p></p>
<div>It&#8217;s simple cross promotion. I write a post detailing how your product helped me write my book. He does this with two popular blogs/products, that I have seen. If anyone finds anymore, please let me know in the comments and I will add an update. See below:</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div>As a consumer of services offered by both of Jamaica&#8217;s largest banks, it pains me to deal with the little things that the banks take for granted.</div>
<p></p>
<div>For instance, look at how they quote the currency exchange rates.</div>
<p></p>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NCB</span></div>
<p></p>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<img alt="Ncb-fx_rates" height="334" src="/images/2010/12/07/ui-tip-for-jamaican-banks/NCB-FX_Rates.png" width="445">
</div>
<br></span></div>
<p></p>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bank of Nova Scotia Jamaica (BNS JA)</span></div>
<p></p>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<img alt="Bns-ja-fx_rates" height="408" src="/images/2010/12/07/ui-tip-for-jamaican-banks/BNS-JA-FX_Rates.png" width="500">
</div>
<br></span></div>
<p></p>
<div>This always confuses me. What do these rates mean? Who is doing the buying and selling?</div>
<p></p>
<div>A simple tip, that will get rid of ambiguity adding the word &#8220;You&#8221;, or &#8220;We&#8221;. So it reads &#8220;You Buy (Cash)&#8221;, &#8220;You Buy (CHQ)&#8221;, &#8220;You Sell&#8221;.</div>
<p></p>
<div>You (the bankers) have to remember that you guys are the experts. You guys get these quotes in real-time and update them many times throughout the day. To you, it is abundantly clear what these rates mean.</div>
<p></p>
<div>To &#8216;John Public&#8217;, that does an FX transaction once a month or once a few weeks or once a few months, we don&#8217;t have time to memorize how you are portraying this. Every time I come to one of these charts I say to myself &#8220;Which vantage point are they giving me this information from again? Is it mine, or theirs?&#8221;. Then I remember that it is yours, and that just seems selfish.</div>
<p></p>
<div>At the end of the day, it&#8217;s not about you&#8230;it&#8217;s about your customer.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Who cares what you buy and sell FX for? What we (your customers) care about is how much WE will pay, and how much WE will get if we sell to you. </div>
<p></p>
<div>You are welcome :)</div>

  <div class="entry-content">Patrick McKenzie was able to avoid <a href="http://marcgayle.com/startups-death-death-from-1000-cuts">death by 1,000 cuts</a> by finally launching. From one hacker to another&#8230;congratulations.<p></p>
<div>Appointment Reminder, not only has a pretty descriptive and unambiguous app name - which is awesome - but allows you (as a business owner that relies on booking clients for appointments - i.e. doctors, dentists, etc.) to <a href="https://www.appointmentreminder.org/">easily setup automated appointment reminders for your customers</a>, and gently reminds them via a phone call or text message. Do check it out, you can even <a href="https://www.appointmentreminder.org/a/calendar">try a free demo</a>.</div> <p></p>
<div><a href="https://www.appointmentreminder.org"><img title="billboard.jpg" src="https://www.appointmentreminder.org/wp-images/billboard.jpg" alt="billboard.jpg"></a></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You hardly ever hear of a startup that just goes *poof* one day and suddenly implodes. The more common occurrence are a series of bad decisions by management and/or the founders. This also applies to larger companies too.</p>
<p></p>
<div>One of the things I have encountered while building <a href="http://www.compversions.com">Comp Versions</a> is that it is easy to become overwhelmed by the amount of work ahead of you. Especially when it is now common mantra to get something out as quickly as possible.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Even more especially when you have to be learning programming as you go along, are doing it by yourself and bootstrapping - talk about bad odds.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Although I have completed a major milestone (the majority of the Rails back-end is done), I have now started the front-end. </div>
<p></p>
<div>Let me tell you, it is quite daunting when I look at my stylesheet and it is ~600 lines long, and I know that I still have about 80% of the application left of the front-end to complete.</div>
<p></p>
<div>This is further compounded when I spend an entire day (or two days) being stumped by some alignment issues of <li> items. Although, I must confess, once I complete that it feels SOOO good and there are cumulative effects - i.e. I will never have that problem again, and the issue is fixed everywhere else in the app that is needed. </li>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Each of these &#8216;stumpings&#8217; is a cut. If I let this cut stop me, or conquer me, I am doomed to give up. In the cumulative, I am quite scarred (note: not &#8216;scared&#8217;) at the moment and I know I will be further scarred in the weeks ahead.</div>
<p></p>
<div>But I have no choice but to get out my box of band-aids and press ahead.</div>
<p></p>
<div>This is one of the reasons why many people recommend going all-in (i.e. quitting your day-job, and giving up everything else). When you are all-in, each cut is a milestone. </div>
<p></p>
<div>So don&#8217;t look at it like I am one more cut closer to quitting, but rather - one more cut closer to the 1,000 before I get to launch.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So here is to about 450 more.</div>
<p></p>
<div>You should <a href="http://www.twitter.com/marcgayle" title="Marc Gayle on Twitter" target="_blank">follow me</a> on twitter.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div>After watching an interview with Jason Calacanis, I can safely say that I would never want to work for him, and never want to model my company to be anything remotely like his. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am not knocking Jason personally, I just think his work values are wack. Correction, I think his values (or those that I can see by his public persona) are wack.</div>
<p></p>
<div>There I said it.</div>

</p>
<div>In a world that is flat, where the best technical talent can go anywhere, who on earth would want to go and work for a company whose CEO specifically states that he has no interest in employees that want &#8216;balance&#8217;. Talk about a shitty job experience. </div>
<p></p>
<div>The worst part about all of this, is that I am yet to see Jason produce the &#8216;high quality&#8217; product that his supposed &#8220;abnormal&#8221; (his words, not mine) work ethic produces. Perhaps that&#8217;s valuable in journalism where you have to fight for the best leads to break the best stories - so I can see how that MIGHT be applicable at Weblogs, Inc. but even that is pushing it.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Jason also equated not wanting to sell your soul and work 80 hour weeks to being &#8216;normal&#8217;, i.e. it&#8217;s not exceptional and you don&#8217;t produce outstanding results being &#8216;normal&#8217;. </div>
<p></p>
<div>I guess when you have F U money, you really can say and do anything without caring about the repercussions, but I don&#8217;t think Jason realizes that the best leaders inspire (not intimidate). </div>
<p></p>
<div>I am yet to hear of anyone &#8216;brag&#8217; that they work at Mahalo. All the instances I have seen of people discussing their jobs at Mahalo, it has usually been followed with &#8216;&#8230;.yeah&#8230;I know&#8217;.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I am still in disbelief that he really believes this.</div>
<p></p>
<div>But&#8230;I guess, coming from the guy that thought he could pay for Digg&#8217;s top users, it isn&#8217;t much of a shock.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div>I hereby suggest that we, as the web development community, from herein going forward ban all references to uniques, pageviews and hits.</div>
<p></p>
<div>The only metric that really matters to the creation of a viable web company is revenues - but more specifically profits. Not just revenues &amp; profits, but revenues &amp; profits per month. </div>
<p></p>
<div>It&#8217;s not about making $1M in one month and nothing for the next 20 years (although, if that&#8217;s your MO, kudos to you). It&#8217;s about building a sustainable business that generates steady monthly revenues and profits.</div>

<div>It is very difficult for me to think of any other industry, in history, where you can build a product company with net margins (i.e. after all costs and expenses are taken out from revenues) of 50+% on a monthly recurring basis, with literally one or two people. Said another way, once the product is built, $0.50 of every dollar earned is profit. This assumes that you will be reinvesting X % of your revenues in marketing to drive future growth and building out your team. Of course, as you expand and grow your net margins will reduce significantly because of higher expenses (staff/HR, infrastructure, etc.). But the figures are incredibly attractive&#8230;almost Ponzi-like.</div>
<p></p>
<div>However, hits/pageviews/uniques don&#8217;t buy slippers for your daughter&#8217;s dance recital - so from here on out, I suggest we put more of a focus on revenues generated on a monthly basis - and not on those other metrics.</div>
<p></p>
<div>If your app/site is dependent on advertising and eyeballs, then this can&#8217;t fully apply to you. But I would suggest that perhaps you might want to look at other options &amp; business models.</div>
<p></p>
<div><em>Editors Note: While I acknowledge that &#8216;banning&#8217; the use of those metrics is a bit of hyperbole (there are good uses for them in some situations), I think we need a major shift in mindset from eyeballs (i.e. uniques and pageviews) to more business/profit centric metrics. Many people are uncomfortable with this idea, so I think we should start the shift now so that more and more people can get comfortable with it and migrate to it - for the long term viability of our industry&#8217;s sake. Profits don&#8217;t kill people. People kill people.</em></div>

<div><em>Aside: The idea for this post came from me going through the process of trying to figure out a pricing plan for my, soon-to-be-released, web app targeted specifically at designers and agencies that need to <a href="http://www.compversions.com" title="CompVersions - viewing multiple versions of graphic files easily." target="_blank">share multiple versions of their graphic work</a> with clients and other stakeholders.</em></div>
