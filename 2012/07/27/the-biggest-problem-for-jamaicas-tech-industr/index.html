	<h2 class="title">The Biggest Problem, for Jamaica's Tech Industry, Is the Sum of Our Smaller Problems</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><div>I just came from lunch with <a href="http://www.jamdeal.com">Chad Cunningham</a> and <a href="http://www.edufocal.com">Gordon Swaby</a>. We are trying to figure out, and put into words, the issues facing tech (more specifically internet/web) companies in Jamaica for a meeting with a government official coming up shortly.</div>
<p></p>
<div>After going through many scenarios of issues we face, the recurring theme always came back to the &#8220;small problems&#8221;. </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Registering an LLC easily &amp; cheaply</li>
<li>Getting all documentation and tax compliance information in order for everything to be above board.</li>
<li>Getting health insurance for the owner and the handful of employees (and their families)</li>
<li>Accepting VISA, Mastercard, Discover, American Express from any consumer around the world</li>
<li>Doing business with US-based organizations</li>
<li>Importing any equipment we may need (laptops, computers, networking equipment, iPads, etc.) for everyday use - with a predictable cost. Right now, you never know what the end cost will be once the various duties and levies are attached.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Right now, all of the above are a headache in one way or another.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I have had to register a US-based Delaware Corp to get a US bank account to allow me to get a US payment processor account to process US-issued credit cards. All of that was easier (not easy) than working with the local banks. Not to mention that the local banks don&#8217;t process (the last I checked) Discover and American Express issued cards.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Gordon eloquently summed up our current problems with this phrase that I love so much that I had to write a post about it.</div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>&#8220;Our biggest problem is the sum of our smaller problems.&#8221;</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Tech startups don&#8217;t need a government run Venture Capital arm - what we need is a regulatory &amp; justice system that allows investors to purchase preferred shares (or even common shares) in our companies and be adequately protected (both from culpability &amp; liability for the wrong-doings of any companies they invest in). Just like a typical equity investment in the US.</li>
<li>Tech startups don&#8217;t need a government run health insurance program - what we need is to be able to buy insurance from the existing entities on similar terms that any individual can get by joining Churches Credit Union, or JN.</li>
<li>Tech startups don&#8217;t need large tax incentives because our net margins are high, and paying taxes is a good problem to have.</li>
<li>Tech startups don&#8217;t need any government land or buildings - because we can get by in our own homes/garages/offices.</li>
<li>Tech startups don&#8217;t need special treatment - all we need is fair treatment. We need the government to either issue new banking licenses to encourage competition in the banking industry - specifically to a bank interested in specializing in e-commerce transactions. From selling products online, to managing subscription payments in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) apps.  Or heavily lean on existing institutions to be more e-commerce friendly, although&#8230;the skeptic in me thinks we would be better off with good old-fashioned competition. Issuing a new banking license to an entity interested in mobile &amp; e-commerce would probably be the best bet.</li>
<li>Tech startups don&#8217;t even need import waivers, we just need certainty. We need to know that if we are bringing in an iPad, once it touches the shores we will be paying a flat fee (that is reasonable, 50%+ is NOT reasonable) for duty. We already know, via Mailpac, what the flat fee for the shipping will be. We need to know all the other flat fees.</li>
</ul>
<div>Once those problems are fixed, the last thing we need is for JAMPRO to tell the world that Jamaica&#8217;s tech industry is open for business.</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Show investors that there is a clear path to liquidity via our Junior Stock Exchange and JSE (especially through a USD offering). </div>
<p></p>
<div>In short, we just need the government to streamline the basic issues that we have to deal with - i.e. the &#8220;small, every day problems&#8221;, and we will take care of the rest.</div>
<p></p>
