In the first part of this series about <a href="http://marcgayle.com/2010/05/07/greece-debt-crisis-explained-part-one/" title="Greece Debt Crisis Explained - Part One" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">the Greece crisis</a>, we looked at the causes of crises in general and some of the elements that led to Greece’s crisis specifically.</span></p>


<p>The single most important factor in financial markets is confidence. Confidence in everything. From the political system to strength of the local currency to regulators to central bankers. In October 2009, the new Greek Prime Minister shattered market confidence by announcing that several revisions have to be made on their reported numbers (i.e. they have been lying) starting with the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2009/10/22/afx7033114.html" title="Greece Lied" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">budget deficit being double previous estimates</a> @ 12.5% of GDP. As a result of that announcement, which was the absolute right thing for the new Prime Minister to do, the credit ratings agencies <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2009/10/22/afx7033114.html" title="Fitch downgrades Greece debt" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">downgraded</a><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8426085.stm" title="Greece downgraded by all three rating agencies" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">Greece’s debt</a>.</p>


<p>The new Greek government kept dithering about whether or not they need assistance. To further compound the issue, the EU and IMF were back and forth about whether or not they <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a4vrygzcbJbk" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">would come to Greece’s rescue</a>. The first version of the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article7060757.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000" title="25 Billion Euro Greek Bailout Plan" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">bailout plan was only 25 Billion Euros</a>. Even when this was presented, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-31/greece-may-be-heading-back-to-square-one-on-aid-as-bonds-fall.html" title="Markets fall on $25B bailout package" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">the markets were still not convinced</a> that everything would be ok. EU leaders and the IMF were forced to go back to the drawing board and come up with a more ‘potent’ solution. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-05-02/greece-bailout-plan-includes-support-fund-for-country-s-banks.html" title="$147B bailout package agreed" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">A $147B bailout</a> package was put together, that seems to have <a href="http://www.salon.com/wires/techbiz/2010/04/11/D9F1AEK00_world_markets/" title="Stocks higher on Greece bailout plan" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">soothed markets fears</a> about Greece’s problems. However, the steep austerity measures demanded by the IMF and the EU didn’t sooth the<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/05/04/greece.bailout.protests/index.html" title="Greeks protest austerity measures by IMF" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">fears of the Greeks</a> who will have to pay dearly for the years of profligacy by their elected officials.</p>


<p>Just when things were being contained in Greece, S&amp;P downgraded <a href="http://www.whtc.com/news/articles/2010/apr/27/sp-downgrades-portugal-two-notches/" title="S&amp;P downgrades Portugal" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">Portugal</a> &amp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2010/04/28/general-eu-europe-financial-crisis_7558663.html?boxes=Homepagebusinessnews" title="S&amp;P downgrades Spain" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">Spain’s</a> debt. This causes panic among investors as <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/fundsNews/idINN2823961120100428" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">stock markets</a> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100428-716525.html?mod=WSJ_World_MIDDLEHeadlinesEurope" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">all over the world</a> start to decline. The EU is forced back into a corner, and has no choice but to fight. Come out swinging they did. The EU leaders, IMF and the US put together a <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/37061547" title="Trillion dollar european bailout" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">$1 Trillion bailout package</a> for <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/10753330/1/cramers-mad-money-recap-europe-bailouts-the-real-deal-final.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEN" title="Trillion dollar bailout for Europe." target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">all troubled Euro nations</a>.</p>


<p>So, in summary…we have seen a small country that first ‘needed’ a $25B bailout, turn into a large $1T bailout for the entire EU (basically). What exciting times we live in. If it is one thing these regulators seem to have learned, it is that fear and uncertainty can spread <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_Financial_Crisis" title="Asian financial crisis" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">contagion all over</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American_debt_crisis" title="Latin American debt crisis" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">world in no-time flat</a>. They seem to have tried to get in front of it this time. Although…there are <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world_business/view/1055982/1/.html" title="Euro down on trillion dollar bailout" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">early signs that there are still doubts</a>. Hopefully, this is another crisis diverted.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1325747" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">this question at Hacker News</a>, I decided to write a series of posts about the Greece Debt Crisis (as I understand it anyway). Hopefully this is helpful to someone, and if you have any particular questions or sections of the crisis that you would like me to try and explain please feel free to let me know in the comments. Also, don’t forget to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/marcgayle" title="Subscribe to my feed" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">subscribe to my feed</a> to get notified when I post additional parts of this series.</p>

<p><strong>What causes a government debt crisis?</strong></p>


<p>Typically, governments carry a certain amount of debt on their books as standard operating procedure. These are in the form of bonds. A ‘normal’ amount of between 20% – 65% is usually fine, for most countries. This actually works well, because when the fiscal situation of the government is in good order (i.e. when the government is earning enough to cover the interest on the debt + invest in infrastructure and projects that produce growth) the government is actually doing investors a huge service by providing a ‘risk-free’ asset for them to include in their diversified portfolios. The crisis comes about when the government’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-GDP_ratio" title="Debt to GDP Ratio - Wikipedia" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">debt-to-GDP</a> ratio reaches to dangerous levels (usually 120%+) and the fundamentals of their fiscal situation becomes shaky. i.e. either GDP growth slows/stops, revenue measures are inadequate (taxpayers avoid paying their fair share by bribing officials), spending gets wildly out of control, or any combination of the three. The result of this is that the ability for the government to honor their interest payments becomes in jeopardy.</p>


<p><strong>What caused Greece’s debt crisis?</strong></p>


<p>So Greece, unfortunately, has a combination of those factors. According to <a href="http://www.mnec.gr/export/sites/mnec/en/economics/greek_economy_prospects/FactSheet_January07_Eng.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">Greece’s Ministry of Finance</a> (PDF), up to 2007 Greece had GDP growth rates of between 2.5% and 5% from 1996 – 2006. However, as later posts will show, it is important to note that perhaps those GDP growth figures are now to be taken with a grain of salt – as it has been revealed that previous administrations have been ‘cooking the books’. The following image shows a nice comparison of Greece and the rest of the EU during that period:</p>

</div>


<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html" title="Greece: CIA World Factbook" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">CIA World Factbook</a>, Greece had estimated GDP growth rates in the latter years of 4% in 2007, 2% in 2008 and -2% in 2009. So while growth has slowed significantly over the years, given that we just came out of a severe fiscal crisis, those numbers don’t look that bad. However, when we look at their other measures we can see the crisis intensifying. Eurostat, an EU agency, <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-22042010-BP/EN/2-22042010-BP-EN.PDF" title="Eurostat: Greece budget deficit revised" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">recently put out a report</a> (PDF) that paints a damning picture of the Greece fiscal situation.</p>

<p>From the report, one of the things they show are the levels of government revenues (as % of GDP) and government expenditures from 2006 – 2009. This is what it says:</p>


<p>Gov. Expenditures: 2006 = 43.2% of GDP; 2007 = 45%; 2008 = 46.8%; 2009 = 50.4%;</p>


<p>Gov. Revenues: 2006 = 39.3% of GDP, 2007 = 39.7%; 2008 = 39.1%; 2009 = 36.9%;</p>


<p>You can generally see that the trend should be reversed. The expenses should be going down, while income goes up! The increasing expenses can be attributed to generally powerful labor unions, and free-wheeling politicians that promise more than they probably should.</p>


<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>


<p>We have seen, in Part One, that the fundamentals of the Greek economy started to falter before the economic crisis hit. In other parts we will dive deeper into what caused the sudden surge in anxiety and possible contagion effects. If you have any questions that you would like me to address, please feel free to let me know in the comments section below. I have a general guide of what I want to cover, but I am fairly flexible.</p>

</div>




<p>The Wall Street Journal recently had an article about the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704388304575202413074193720.html?mod=WSJ_article_MoreIn" title="Fed preparing to sell mortgages" target="_blank">Fed getting ready to start off-loading the $1.1T worth</a> of mortgages they bought during the crisis (in an attempt to save the banks).</p>


<p>From the article (note, I added emphasis):</p>


<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>At $1.1 trillion in holdings of mortgage debt guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, the Fed owns roughly a fifth of all these outstanding instruments.</p>
<p>Some Fed officials are pushing for a more aggressive approach. In April, Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, called for <strong>monthly sales of $15 billion to $25 billion</strong> to eliminate the Fed’s mortgage holdings <strong>within five years</strong>. “It is likely the Fed will have to sell a nontrivial amount of its MBS holdings,” he concluded. Some Fed policy makers—among them Charles Plosser of Philadelphia, Jeffrey Lacker of Richmond and Kevin Warsh at the Fed board—are sympathetic.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>At first glance, so much money has been thrown around in the media that 1.1 Trillion Dollars seems like it’s not so big. To put it into perspective, let’s look at some prospective buyers and see how much they would be able to buy and how long they would last:</p>


<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:BRK.A&amp;fstype=ii" title="Berkshire Hathaway Financials" target="_blank">Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A)</a> – According to Google Finance, Warren Buffet’s investment company had approximately $30.5B in cash and short-term equivalents at the end of the last fiscal year. Assuming they have the same amount of cash (which is probably inaccurate, but just simplifying), and also assuming that Warren Buffet wanted to buy as many mortgage backed securities from the Federal Reserve as he could get his hands on, and also assuming that he was prepared to use all of his cash to do so…he could only participate in a maximum of 2 months (let’s call it 1.5months) worth of sales by the Fed – before he runs out cash. So that’s one large investment company down, with only 58.5 months of sales to go.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:GS&amp;fstype=ii" title="Goldman Sachs Financials" target="_blank">Goldman Sachs (GS)</a> –  had approximately $38.21B in cash and short-term equivalents. So they would be able to participate for 2 months. So only 56.5 months to go.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.pionline.com/article/20100308/CHART2/100309910" title="The Largest Hedge Funds in the World" target="_blank">The largest hedge funds in the World</a> – with total assets under management of approximately $530B, if they were able to ‘magically’ liquidate their holdings and purchase from the fed…that entire process would take between 21.2 – 35.33 months. So only 25 more months to go (assuming some middle ground between both values is chosen).</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:GOOG&amp;fstype=ii" title="Google financials" target="_blank">Google (GOOG)</a> – had $24.5B cash on hand. So they can play ball for approximately 1 month.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:MSFT&amp;fstype=ii" title="Microsoft Financials" target="_blank">Microsoft (MSFT)</a> – had $31B cash…so they can last 1.5 months as well.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:KO&amp;fstype=ii" title="Coca-Cola Financials" target="_blank">Coca-Cola (KO)</a> –    Only has $9B, so they can’t even sit at the table and participate (again, this assumes one company per month, to get the shortest time of getting rid of the mortgages as possible).</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:AAPL&amp;fstype=ii" title="Apple Financials" target="_blank">Apple (AAPL)</a> – Has $24B, so they can participate for 1 month.</li>
</ul>


<p>Only 21.5 more months to go.</p>


<p>I know this is a major simplification, it’s just an interesting exercise to look at. Especially in this media climate with hundreds of zeroes thrown all over the place. Also note that I have not included large pension funds, retirement schemes, etc. that typically have very large wads of cash…mainly because those funds tend to be abstract to most people. When you see companies constantly in the news, it’s easier to visualize how big the Fed’s balance sheet is.</p>


<p>Hope that puts it into perspective.</p>


<p>Another thing I have been thinking about lately, is the part of the proposal that will regulate the financial industry (I am pro reform) that creates a ‘bailout kitty’. i.e. the liabilities of large financial institutions will be taxed and stored in this kitty. What I am wondering is this: Where will that money be invested and who will manage it? If they (the managers of said kitty) ‘play it safe’ by investing in sovereign debt, which country’s debt? Won’t that create some perverse incentive for countries to keep running fiscal deficits because they have a literal ‘large pot of gold’ sitting down at their disposal that will allow them to finance any program they want to finance? i.e. moral hazard of the political sort.</p>


<p>Not saying the liabilities shouldn’t be taxed, and the kitty not created…just saying…it might have unintended consequences that are not currently being discussed. However, that might be the subject of another post.</p>
