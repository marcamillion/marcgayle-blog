    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google just announced that they have rolled out a new indexing system for their search engine, called Caffeine.</p>

<p>Here are some interesting quotes:</p>

<blockquote>Some background for those of you who don't build search engines for a living like us: when you search Google, you're not searching the live web. Instead you're searching Google's index of the web which, like the list in the back of a book, helps you pinpoint exactly the information you need. (Here's aÂ <a href="http://www.google.com/howgoogleworks/">good explanation</a> of how it all works.)</blockquote>


<p>What's even more intriguing is the amount of data they process:</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Caffeine lets us index web pages on an enormous scale. In fact, every second Caffeine processes hundreds of thousands of pages in parallel. If this were a pile of paper it would grow three miles taller every second. Caffeine takes up nearly 100 million gigabytes of storage in one database and adds new information at a rate of hundreds of thousands of gigabytes per day. You would need 625,000 of the largest iPods to store that much information; if these were stacked end-to-end they would go for more than 40 miles.</blockquote>


<p>I can't even fathom that amount of data.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those that might not know, RAM = Random Access Memory. This is the memory that a computer uses to temporarily store data while it is in use. If you have bought a computer recently, or are familiar with the specifications on your computer, you will notice that it will be anywhere from 512MB to 4-6GB. Your hard drive capacity (which is the other GB rating on your computer) is usually much larger. Say 250GB, even up to 2,000 GB (2 Tera Bytes) in some cases.</p>
