  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I build web products - <a href="http://5kmvp.com">Minimum Viable Products</a> more specifically - for a living.<br /><br /> I love Economics, Finance, Startups, Capitalism and the Web. <br /><br />You will find all sorts of ramblings here - that are usually things I have to get off of my chest. I love what I do. If you find me interesting, you may like <a href="http://twitter.com/marcgayle">some of my Tweets</a>.</p>
