<a href="http://www.wallstats.com/" title="Wall Stats" target="_blank">Wallstats.com</a> has a nice graphic that illustrates the federal budget and how taxes are spent. It also shows, quite nicely, the <strong>gap</strong> between what the government makes and what the government spends - which has to be borrowed - otherwise known as the budget deficit (see the bottom right-side of the graphic).
