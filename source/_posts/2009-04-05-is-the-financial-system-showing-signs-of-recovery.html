In his only <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4866987n%3fsource=search_video%20" title="Ben Bernanke on 60 minutes" target="_blank">60 minutes interview</a>, Ben Bernanke said that one way we will know that things are turning around is:
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">One sign would be that a large bank is successful in raising private equity. Right now, all the private money is sitting on the sidelines saying 'we don't know what these banks are worth', 'we don't know that they are stable' and they are not willing to put their money in the banks.</blockquote>
