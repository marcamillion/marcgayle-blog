From time to time there are those decisions/situations that come along, that challenge us to truly examine our morals/values/ideologies. If we are in a position of power, those morals/values/ideologies could have ever-lasting repercussions on many people.

In Henry Paulson &amp; Ben Bernanke's case, it was billions of people; their 'trigger' moment was the battle between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard" title="Moral Hazard" target="_blank">Moral Hazard</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_risk" title="Systemic Risk" target="_blank">Systemic Risk.</a><!--more-->

I know that we can all get carried away about the large sums of money being thrown around, while trying to figure out who created this mess to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123414310280561945.html" title="Government intervention created this mess" target="_blank">cast blame</a>, but sometimes we should just take a step back and appreciate the tough task that our regulators and political figures have in front of them.

<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/" title="PBS Frontline - Inside the Meltdown" target="_blank">PBS's Frontline</a> did an excellent documentary that takes us deep inside the financial crisis with key players. Representatives Barney Frank &amp; Chris Dodd explain the scene in the room when Bernanke and Paulson told the leaders of the House and Senate that the entire financial system could collapse...in a matter of days. Who knew that a documentary could feel like a horror/suspense movie?...that financial decisions could be felt with the same weight as a Mafioso boss trying to decide what to do with the mole that he found within his organization that also happens to be married to his daughter? 

I know that it's an hour long, but take the time, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/meltdown/view/" title="PBS Frontline - Inside the Meltdown" target="_blank">watch it and enjoy</a>. It's well worth it.
