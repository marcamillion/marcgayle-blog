<div>I have been meaning to write this post for a while, but it kept getting delayed. Then Mashable published <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/11/11/google-promoted-account/">this article</a> about Google Advertising on Twitter.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So I figured now is as good a time as any.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I am no ad buying expert, but if Microsoft can bid on very cheap/obscure keywords (i.e. the extreme longtail) - e.g. every single keyword that costs $0.01 or less (if that even exists), assuming that the revenue they can generate per lead is greater than $0.01, then why not do it? Then from there, experiment with $0.02 keywords, and progress accordingly.</div>
<p></p>
<div>It is possible (I would think), by doing that - rather than an <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10255678-56.html">aggressive mainstream media advertising blitz</a> - that their conversion rates would be much better and they could steal a good chunk of Google's traffic.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Naturally, it has to make economic sense. I imagine they must measure the cost of every lead and with the waste that is generated with large TV campaigns, it's not hard to conceive that a strict online ad inventory buying campaign would generate warmer leads than an offline TV campaign.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Am I wrong? Would love to hear some thoughts on that.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Edit: Some interesting links provided to me by the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1895324" target="_blank">thread on Hacker News</a>, although they don't specifically point out data from Bing, it is interesting nonetheless: </div>
