There is a video floating around the interwebs about the current state of our world. I can almost assure you that as you watch it for the first time, you are going to be surprised by at least a few of these statistics (if not many of them). Some of them might be glaringly obvious, but it can really cause you to take a step back when you see the actual numbers.Â
