<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0.8ex; border-left-width: 1px; border-left-color: #cccccc; border-left-style: solid; padding-left: 1ex;">The act of accumulating a number (say 'n') of unread/unprocessed tabs left open in a browser window such that the next day rather than starting with 0 tabs open, you start with n.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<div>Also can be summed up as: X = X + Y, </div>
<p></p>
<div>where X = the number of tabs open at the beginning of the day, </div>
<div>and Y = the number of tabs opened throughout the day.</div>
<p></p>
<div>This has become a major problem, so much so that when my browser crashes and I am forced to start over, I actually breathe a sigh of relief as I start from a fresh canvas.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Every single day I start the day with both my browsers looking like these two images:</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<img alt="Tab-set-1" height="8" src="/images/2011/09/10/tab-debt/Tab-Set-1.png" width="500">
<img alt="Tab-set-2" height="7" src="/images/2011/09/10/tab-debt/Tab-Set-2.png" width="500">
</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>So many tabs that I can't even see the name. It's not long before I I can't even see the favicons.</p>
<div>Btw, these are tabs left open after I have sent those that I can send to my Kindle and closed those.</div>
<p></p>
<div>This is almost as bad as having an unwieldy inbox. But what is the solution to this?</div>
<p></p>
<div>I would love some help with this problem, because it is becoming more ridiculous by the day.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Help!</div>
<p></p>
