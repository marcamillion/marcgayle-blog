<div>Please don't get me wrong. I am one of those people that supported your nascent campaign once you declared in Illinois. If I could have voted in 2008, I would have voted for you.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Even though I am not Congressman Wilson, I have to say it, you lied! </div> <p></p>
<div>You have said that you would rather be a really good <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN/Politics/president-obama-good-term-president/story?id=9657337">one-term president</a>, than a mediocre two-term president.</div> <p></p>
<div>As is evidenced from the way you recklessly managed the debt ceiling issue, you clearly had the 2012 re-election campaign in your sights.</div>
<p></p>
<div>The right thing for the country, and the world, would have been for you to stick to loose fiscal policy in the immediate-short term, and lay out a credible medium term plan for reigning in the deficits and paying down the debt once the economy has fully recovered. But you did just the opposite - with allowing the Republicans to cajoling you into short-term spending cuts and shirking the responsibility for the real tough decisions (like tackling social security, and medicare reform) to a Congressional Committee.</div> <p></p>
<div>The ironic thing is, as you can see from the markets reaction, if the economy continues to deteriorate and slips back into a recession just in the nick of time of the next re-election - you will likely be the worst combination of what you wanted. </div> <p></p>
<div>A mediocre one-term president.</div>
<p></p>
<div>That would be a travesty, because you had so much potential.</div>
