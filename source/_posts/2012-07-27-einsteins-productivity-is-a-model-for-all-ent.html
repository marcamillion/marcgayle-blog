<div>The next time you think "I will start {X} another time. I have too much going on now...." consider this.</div>
<p></p>
<div>During the period when Albert Einstein wrote his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#1905_-_Annus_Mirabilis_papers">4 papers that revolutionized physics</a> (including "The General Theory of Relativity"), he had a few things going in his life....including but not limited to:</div> <div>
<ul>
<li>A full-time job in a patent office in Bern, Switzerland where he worked 6 days - 8 hours a day (yes 6 days). </li>
<li>A relatively new wife (who most of his family hated/despised, at least initially)</li>
<li>They had a daughter, but there is no record of what happened with the daughter (insinuating that maybe his wife lost the baby or they gave her up for adoption - though there is no evidence to suggest as much). Either way, this must have been taxing emotionally.</li> <li>They then had a son - Hans Albert Einstein</li>
<li>Einstein played in a string quartet once a week.</li>
<li>He had no access to a library to read other publications (because the library was usually closed when he wasn't at work).</li> <li>Oh...and he had no computer &amp; no Google =)</li>
</ul>
<div>Even despite these obstacles, he wrote 4 papers that fundamentally transformed physics and subsequently engineering.</div>
