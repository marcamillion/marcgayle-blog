It's about time! <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090330/bs_nm/us_autos_taskforce" title="U.S. autos task force rejects GM, Chrysler plans" target="_blank">Reuters is reporting that</a>:
<blockquote>...The Obama administration autos task force on Monday rejected the turnaround plans of <span class="yshortcuts">General Motors Corp</span> and<span class="yshortcuts">Chrysler LLC</span> and warned both could be put through bankruptcy to slash debts.

The announcement by the <span class="yshortcuts">White House</span> autos panel headed by former <span class="yshortcuts">investment banker</span> Steve Rattner marked a stunning reversal for management at both automakers and for GM investors and creditors who had bet on a softer line.</blockquote>
