Alexis your <a href="http://alexisohanian.com/an-open-letter-to-kevin-rose" title="An open letter to Kevin Rose from Alexis Ohanian" target="_blank">recent blog post to Kevin Rose re: Digg</a> struck a wrong chord with me. For those not familiar with what he is talking about, a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/28/exclusive-video-and-screenshots-of-digg-version-4/" title="Sneak Peak at Digg Version 4" target="_blank">new video giving details about upcoming changes for Digg version 4</a> was released today.<p></p>
I can see how on the surface these changes look like a clone of other more popular features, but I suspect you might be mis-interpreting what's happening here.<p></p>
Yes, many of the features look and feel like competitors. But so does the iPod. It plays mp3s? Yuck! So does Rhapsody's player, why would I want one from Apple. So does a Mercedes/BMW, it has wheels + an engine.<p></p>
The issue is the way it does what it does. I have not used it just yet, but from what I have seen, this could fundamentally be as much of a game changer as the first version of digg was to giving individual publishers a bigger voice.<p></p>
Imagine...now, as a publisher, I have 200 'followers' whose sole interest is in seeing the links/stories that I publish. <a href="http://mixergy.com/jason-fried-customers-clips/" title="Jason Fried on Mixergy" target="_blank">Jason Fried talks about building</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/5806452173" title="Jason Fried building an audience" target="_blank">an audience</a>. So far, there is no other tool that 'aggregates' all your content and pushes it directly to an audience like digg v4 is suggested to do.<p></p>
People use Twitter to do this, but it wasn't built to do that. It was built for messages of 140 characters. Valuable in it's own right, but not as a 'media publishing' tool. <p></p>
People use status updates on Facebook to do that, but it wasn't made for that. It was made to update friends on your latest activities (i.e. uploaded new videos/photos, add new quotes, friended new people, got engaged/married....other things that your social graph might find of value).
<p></p>But for publishers trying to build an audience, there isn't one tool that allows an audience to 'subscribe' to everything of interest to them.Yes, you can have a blog with an RSS feed. Your twitter feed has an RSS feed, etc. But RSS feed readers suck!
<p></p>The mere fact that I can have one place, that streamlines all of the links published by people I am interested in hearing from + links they found interesting, is absolutely game-changing (in my opinion).Ofcourse, it all comes down execution, but based on what I am seeing, I think I see Kevin back in his original form. Quite contrary to your assertion about pandering to his VCs, I don't see any evidence of driving revenues. I see mainly product development. I see small UI elements that seem to enhance the link discovery process. I see giving value to small-time publishers and further 'democratization' of news.
<p></p>So while I respect that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I would caution us all to wait and see how it unfolds, and actually use it - before casting judgement. Many <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/05/ive-changed-my-mind-about-the-ipad.html" target="_blank">high profile people have done that recently and have had to do mea cuplas</a>.<p></p>
Maybe I am biased, because I am one of those that submit stories that stall or get a handful of diggs. This looks like it could be a significant game changer for me. Maybe it won't guarantee all my stories will make it to the front page, but I would not be surprised if my content got easily 200% - 800% more traffic, as a direct result of this change.
<p></p>THAT...would be game changing.
