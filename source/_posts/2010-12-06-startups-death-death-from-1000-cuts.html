<p>You hardly ever hear of a startup that just goes *poof* one day and suddenly implodes. The more common occurrence are a series of bad decisions by management and/or the founders. This also applies to larger companies too.</p>
<p></p>
<div>One of the things I have encountered while building <a href="http://www.compversions.com">Comp Versions</a> is that it is easy to become overwhelmed by the amount of work ahead of you. Especially when it is now common mantra to get something out as quickly as possible.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Even more especially when you have to be learning programming as you go along, are doing it by yourself and bootstrapping - talk about bad odds.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Although I have completed a major milestone (the majority of the Rails back-end is done), I have now started the front-end. </div>
<p></p>
<div>Let me tell you, it is quite daunting when I look at my stylesheet and it is ~600 lines long, and I know that I still have about 80% of the application left of the front-end to complete.</div>
<p></p>
<div>This is further compounded when I spend an entire day (or two days) being stumped by some alignment issues of <li> items. Although, I must confess, once I complete that it feels SOOO good and there are cumulative effects - i.e. I will never have that problem again, and the issue is fixed everywhere else in the app that is needed. </li>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Each of these 'stumpings' is a cut. If I let this cut stop me, or conquer me, I am doomed to give up. In the cumulative, I am quite scarred (note: not 'scared') at the moment and I know I will be further scarred in the weeks ahead.</div>
<p></p>
<div>But I have no choice but to get out my box of band-aids and press ahead.</div>
<p></p>
<div>This is one of the reasons why many people recommend going all-in (i.e. quitting your day-job, and giving up everything else). When you are all-in, each cut is a milestone. </div>
<p></p>
<div>So don't look at it like I am one more cut closer to quitting, but rather - one more cut closer to the 1,000 before I get to launch.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So here is to about 450 more.</div>
