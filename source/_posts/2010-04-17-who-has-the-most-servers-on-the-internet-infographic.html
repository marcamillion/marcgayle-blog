<p>I have been stumbling across many of these infographics lately, and I couldn’t not share them here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.intac.net/" target="_blank">Intac.net</a> recently put out an awesome infographic that illustrates the companies that dominate the internet (in terms of number of servers). Guess who is the leader, by a long shot. It’s quite staggering actually.Make sure to read the disclaimer at the bottom though….there’s always a disclaimer. Still informative and quite telling.</p>
