<div>Amazon, </div>
<div>        I love what you have done with turning basic web services (most recently <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ses/pricing/" target="_blank">sending batch emails</a>) into a -pay-as-you-go Utility.</div>
<p></p>
<div>But really, you need to simplify your dashboard and reporting. </div>
<p></p>

</div>
<p></p>
<div>Do you seriously expect me to not be confused by this one menu - not to mention it is one of 4 and the others are almost equally as daunting.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Help me help you. I want to continue using your services, but if your interface continues being like this and Apple moves in - unfortunately you will turn into the 'ex'.</div>
<p></p>
<div>So before that happens, don't give them the opportunity. Spend some money on a great design team to simplify this and present it easily.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Thanks.</div>
