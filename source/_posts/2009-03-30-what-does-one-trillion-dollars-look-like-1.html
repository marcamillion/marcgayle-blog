Page Tutor has an awesome post where they illustrate <a href="http://www.pagetutor.com/trillion/index.html" title="What $1T looks like" target="_blank">what $1 trillion dollars looks like</a>. It is reposted below.

--------
<p class="regtext">All this talk about "stimulus packages" and "bailouts"...</p>
<p class="regtext">A <em>billion</em> dollars...</p>
<p class="regtext">A <em>hundred billion</em> dollars...</p>
<p class="regtext"><em>Eight hundred billion</em> dollars...</p>
<p class="regtext">One <em>TRILLION</em> dollars...</p>
<p class="regtext">What does that look like? I mean, these various numbers are tossed around like so many doggie treats, so I thought I'd take <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/">Google Sketchup</a> out for a test drive and try to get a sense of what exactly a trillion dollars <em>looks</em> like.<!--more--></p>
<p class="regtext">We'll start with a $100 dollar bill. Currently the largest U.S. denomination in general circulation. Most everyone has seen them, slighty fewer have owned them. Guaranteed to make friends wherever they go.</p>

<p class="regtext">A packet of one hundred $100 bills is less than 1/2" thick and contains $10,000. Fits in your pocket easily and is more than enough for week or two of shamefully decadent fun.</p>

<p class="regtext">Believe it or not, this next little pile is $1 million dollars (100 packets of $10,000). You could stuff that into a grocery bag and walk around with it.</p>

<p class="regtext">While a measly $1 million looked a little unimpressive, $100 million is a little more respectable. It fits neatly on a standard pallet...</p>

<p class="regtext">And $1 BILLION dollars... now we're really getting somewhere...</p>

<p class="regtext">Next we'll look at ONE TRILLION dollars. This is that number we've been hearing so much about. What is a trillion dollars? Well, it's a million million. It's a thousand billion. It's a one followed by 12 zeros.</p>
<p class="regtext">You ready for this?</p>
<p class="regtext">It's pretty surprising.</p>
<p class="regtext">Go ahead...</p>
<p class="regtext">Scroll down...</p>
<p class="regtext">Ladies and gentlemen... I give you <em>$1 trillion dollars</em>...</p>
<p class="regtext"> </p>

<p class="regtext">Notice those pallets are <em>double stacked</em>.
...and remember those are $100 bills.
</p>
<p class="regtext">So the next time you hear someone toss around the phrase "trillion dollars"... <em>that's</em> what they're talking about.</p>
