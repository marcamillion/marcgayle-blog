As a follow-up to my last piece about <a href="http://marcgayle.com/2010/04/08/why-jason-fried-david-heinemeir-hanson-are-wrong/" title="Why Jason Fried and DHH are wrong about one thing" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">Jason F. &amp; DHH being wrong about one thing</a>, which generated a bunch of chatter (surprisingly more on twitter than on HN) and commentary, I have confirmed that they are indeed right about at least one other thing (I am sure they are right about many things, but I have solid proof for this one).
<p>In their latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1271541853&amp;sr=8-1" title="Rework - by Jason Fried &amp; DHH [Amazon]" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">Rework</a> [Amazon], one of their many principles are ‘pick a fight’. They also talk about having a point of view. So that’s exactly what I did. I read their book, was impressed by how they <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2209-karl-roves-book-vs-rework-what-the-american-people-need-to-know" title="Rework: Karl Rove Attack Ad" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">followed their own advice</a>, and while I agreed with most of their points there was one that I strongly disagreed with. That is their notion that companies should stay small and not aim to grow. I believe <a href="http://marcgayle.com/2010/04/08/why-jason-fried-david-heinemeir-hanson-are-wrong/" title="Why Jason Fried and DHH are wrong" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">we have a moral obligation to grow the companies/ideas that have the ability</a> to do so. Be sure to check out the <a href="http://marcgayle.com/2010/04/08/why-jason-fried-david-heinemeir-hanson-are-wrong/#comment-93" title="DHH replies to why I think he is wrong" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">comments</a>, as the discussion continued.</p>
<p>I can only assume that the reason they say you should pick a fight or have a point of view is that you stand out and get attention (because many companies don’t take sides/positions). If I am wrong, DHH or Jason, please feel free to correct me.</p>
<p>As a result of my fight picking, I saw a huge bump in traffic. I submitted the article to HN and nothing much happened – I had expected a bigger bang, but it puttered out the gate and fizzled in the HN-upcoming story graveyard. Then as a last ditch effort to generate some traffic I simply <a href="http://twitter.com/marcgayle/status/11840978453" title="Tweet about why JF &amp; DHH are wrong" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">sent out a tweet</a>, and both DHH &amp; Jason Fried responded. <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/11842240519" title="Jason Fried's tweet" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">JF retweeted it</a>, and DHH responded on the actual article.</p>
<p>Here are my traffic graphs:</p>

<p>I don’t understand why the bulk of the traffic referrals come up as ‘direct’ when I know that many of them came from either twitter or the bit.ly URL created by Jason Fried and tweeted out.</p>
<p>So, once you have a point of view, and someone else to pick a fight with…doing so can get you some amount of attention.</p>
