For those that might not know, RAM = Random Access Memory. This is the memory that a computer uses to temporarily store data while it is in use. If you have bought a computer recently, or are familiar with the specifications on your computer, you will notice that it will be anywhere from 512MB to 4-6GB. Your hard drive capacity (which is the other GB rating on your computer) is usually much larger. Say 250GB, even up to 2,000 GB (2 Tera Bytes) in some cases.
