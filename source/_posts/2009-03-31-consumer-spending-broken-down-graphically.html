BillShrink has a very insightful <a href="http://www.billshrink.com/blog/consumer-income-spending" title="Bill Shrink - How The Average U.S. Consumers Spend Their Income" target="_blank">blog post</a>.

They breakdown consumer spending, according to various categories. What's interesting is to see how closely consumption is linked to income. Now, I know that's obvious and economists/policy makers design economic policies &amp; tax incentives to exploit this natural phenomenon, but it's always nice to see a nice graphical version of the concepts that we know and take for granted.
