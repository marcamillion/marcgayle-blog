<p><span style="font-family: Palatino, Georgia, Baskerville, serif; font-size: 14px; color: #666666; line-height: 18px;">
<p>In a <a href="http://marcgayle.com/2010/05/28/an-open-letter-to-alexis-ohanian-reddit-cofounder/" title="An open letter to Alexis Ohanian" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">prior post</a> I came out in swinging defense of what I thought was Kevin’s courageous attempt to save Digg and Alexis’s misguided criticisms.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Digg V4 has decided to focus on ‘large publishers’ (like Alexis had thought they would) rather than ‘small publishers’ (whichh I thought they were).</p>
<p>So, given that I quickly (and loudly) appealed to Alexis to be cautious with his critique, I feel it is appropriate to (just as loudly) apologize and admit that I was wrong, and am now disappointed in Digg and Kevin.</p>
<p>I stand corrected Alexis, you were right.</p>
<p>Please note that I am not apologizing just because the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/pda/2010/aug/31/digg-redesign-revolt" title="Digg Users Revolt over v4" target="_blank" style="color: #5f5f5f;">community revolted</a> – communities always revolt when change happens, but they often get used to it – but I am acknowledging that Alexis correctly saw what the true changes at Digg were, as I did not.</p>
