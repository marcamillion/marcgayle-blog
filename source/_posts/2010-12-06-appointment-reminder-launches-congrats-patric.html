Patrick McKenzie was able to avoid <a href="http://marcgayle.com/startups-death-death-from-1000-cuts">death by 1,000 cuts</a> by finally launching.Â From one hacker to another...congratulations.<p></p>
<div>Appointment Reminder, not only has a pretty descriptive and unambiguous app name - which is awesome - but allows you (as a business owner that relies on booking clients for appointments - i.e. doctors, dentists, etc.) to <a href="https://www.appointmentreminder.org/">easily setup automated appointment reminders for your customers</a>, and gently reminds them via a phone call or text message. Do check it out, you can even <a href="https://www.appointmentreminder.org/a/calendar">try a free demo</a>.</div> <p></p>

<div>I wish you all the best.</div>
