	<div class="entry-content"><div>For months before I launched <a href="http://5kmvp.com">5KMVP</a>, I had <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2942856">been</a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4347304">running</a> <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4231436">experiments</a> on Hacker News.</div> <p></p>
<div>Part of the experiment was to validate my thesis.</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<b>Thesis</b>: At some fixed price point, people are willing to invest in building an MVP.</div>
<p></p>
<div>After getting some leads (and projects), over the space of a few months, from HN and talking to many people (from Twitter and HN), a few things jumped out at me.</div>
<p></p>
<div> <ol>
<li>The $5K price point is perfect for what I want to do. It is high enough to weed out people that would likely not value what I bring to the table. It is low enough to reduce friction to get potential customers to say &#8216;Yes&#8217;. It also provides the perfect jumping off point for larger projects. I tried other price points too, from $3K to $7K to $10K. $5K works best for MVPs.</li> <li>Fixed budget &amp; timeline work well - leaving variable scope (to be negotiated with the client). Given that this is an MVP, that works well - because the focus should be on the core &#8216;viable product&#8217; portion of the MVP. So bells &amp; whistles need to be cut.</li> <li>Targeting customers that know what an MVP is, also helps to improve the quality of clients I interact with. They don&#8217;t want a web page that their cousin&#8217;s son-in-law&#8217;s first cousin can build for them, when s(he) is not fixing computers. They want helping figuring out what is their MVP and how should they build it.</li> </ol>
<div>These realizations gave me the confidence to setup a landing page for a service dedicated to <a href="http://5kmvp.com">building minimum viable products</a>.</div>
<p></p>
<div>The next decision I had to make was&#8230;.what will my landing page do? Given that I am a Rails dev, will it be a Rails App? I spoke to a few trusted colleagues and got a variety of responses. Some feedback I got was that I should build a minimalist Rails App that handles the entire engagement (i.e. someone fills out a form, and it pushes that form down a funnel and has all these nice features that allow them to pay easily and keep track of the project as it progresses).</div> <p></p>
<div>I liked the idea at first, but it didn&#8217;t quite sit well with the notion of an MVP. What kept playing in a loop in my head is that I needed to validate the $5K MVP idea before devoting any significant development time to building an app for it.</div> <p></p>
<div>So I bought a theme from <a href="http://themeforest.net">Themeforest</a> (roughly $20) and decided to go meta. Make as minimal an MVP as I can, that validates my hypothesis.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I have one call to action button which is a simple &#8216;mailto:&#8217; button - that launches your email client. Perfect? No&#8230;..but it gets the job done. People that want an MVP built, don&#8217;t want to have to interact with a fancy system. They just want the quickest and easiest way to get in touch with me. Email is that way.</div> <p></p>
<div>I worked on the copy, got my portfolio together and just put it together in a day or 2.<br>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Then, I used <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to <a href="https://github.com/marcamillion/5KMVP">host it</a> (free) along with Google Apps (also free) and launched.<br>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Tweeted it, posted on HN, and wrote a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/30/an-analysis-of-market-demand-for-web-programming-languages/">guest post</a> on Techcrunch.</div>
</div> <p></p>
<div>I am pleased to announce that it has been validated many times over.<br>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>I have gotten multiple projects directly from 5KMVP - at least 1 of which is a multiple of a 5KMVP. It is a multi-phase project that is broken up into manageable chunks. </div> <p></p>
<div>The best thing about this experiment is that 5KMVP is proof positive of me eating my own dogfood. It is also a &#8220;successful&#8221; case study, about correctly deciding what your MVP should be based on what your business goals are. </div> <p></p>
